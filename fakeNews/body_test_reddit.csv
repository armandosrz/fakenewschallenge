Here’s what President Obama guaranteed back when he was on the campaign trail:> “Our conscience cannot rest so long as nearly 45 million Americans don't have health insurance and the millions more who do are going bankrupt trying to pay for it. I have made a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to $2,500 a year. That's not simply a matter of policy or ideology—it's a moral commitment.”> Both those promises have been broken too.Politifact counted that as a [promise broken](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/521/cut-cost-typical-familys-health-insurance-premium-/).> Far from covering every American, Obamacare has left 28 million uninsured.> 28.2 Million Americans are uninsured under ObamacareI don't believe this is ever a promise Obama made. To my knowledge, Obama never promised every American would be covered. So while I imagine this number is true, it's hardly a broken promise on Obama's part.> In fact, despite all the disruption and the billions in spending, as of February 2017 Obamacare’s exchanges cover just 10.3 million people. That’s less than half the number of Americans the Congressional Budget Office estimated back in 2012 would be enrolled.There are a number of reasons for this, not all of them being Obamacare's fault.The gist of it is, as far as I can tell, these claims are largely correct. Obama over-promised on Obamacare, and didn't anticipate the ridiculous amount of pushback from Republicans to undermine the bill at the expense of their own constituents, such as Republican governors' refusing the Medicaid expansion.That being said, it is estimated that the bill did slow down the rise in premiums to a historically low rate, and increased insurance coverage to a historically high rate - Americans, on the whole, would be much worse off without the bill.Does this change the fact that Obama made promises he couldn't keep? No. But it does mean that this line of attack (which is nothing new from those attacking the bill) is missing some extremely important context and using its facts to paint a picture that *isn't* accurate.I'm not going to flair this post myself, in part because I admit that I have some opinions on this issue, but also because I'm conflicted - part of me thinks that this claim deserves a **Confirmed** or **Mostly True** tag, as its claims are technically all true as far as I can tell, save for the one about Obama promising every American would get coverage (which sounds absurd to me). However, part of me feels that the **Partisan Bias** tag is fitting, as the overall message this post is trying to convey with this post is misleading.Anyway, you decide what you think about this.[Here's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/07/05/decoding-the-white-house-spin-on-obamacare-failures/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.55ae97fcb480) an article that discusses exactly what you're talking about, and includes citations. I wouldn't say everything the WH is claiming is entirely untrue, but it's certainly working from cherry-picked data, and makes many assumptions about what that data means without contextualizing any circumstances.RemindMe! 2 days"

2,"One of the main reasons that Obama didn't take action earlier was due to [interference from the Republican Party.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/why-didnt-obama-reveal-intel-about-russias-influence-on-the-election/510242/) Mitch McConnell shares a lot of the blame here. FTA: >White House officials gathered key lawmakers—leadership from the House and Senate, plus the top Democrats and Republicans from both houses’ intelligence and homeland security committees—to ask for a bipartisan condemnation of Russia’s meddling. The effort was stymied by several Republicans who weren’t willing to cooperate, including, reportedly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.I don't see anything in that article about ""Clinton supporters spread false narratives that launched what President Donald Trump has called 'the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.'"" Maybe I'm just missing something, but I didn't see anything in the article to even support the claim you're asking about. So I suppose that means false? In terms of what the article *does* say:I looked up a few of the claims that struck me, they seem generally accurate. The claims about Crowdstrike and the CIA report are inaccurate. There have been a couple posts in this sub-reddit dealing with that topic.The outlet certainly has a slant - for example: 1. It conflates Obama's claims that Russia didn't hack into voting machines with claims that there was no Russian hacking. There was hacking, but it was of the DNC, not voting machines. 2. It cites a Harvard-Harris poll saying voting want less focus on Russia, but doesn't discuss that the the poll found that 68% of voters think that Comey's allegations against Trump are accurate or that the question was whether Congress is focusing too much on Russia and not enough on healthcare or other issues (I'm not surprised most folks think Congress should focus more on healthcare, the economy, security, etc.). [Source](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/339146-poll-voters-grow-weary-of-russia-probes). But aside from those Crowdstrike comments the factual claims seem accurate, though I only checked a few of them.This article conflates election interference with vote fixing, as if the two were the same thing, and cites as one of its sources a conservative talk radio host. In addition, ""false narrative"" is a very vague claim to have checked in factual terms anyway.Given that last point, I'd be inclined to tag this as **Partisan Bias**."
3,"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006In Jan. 2007 it was at 7.7%, and it is now sitting at 7.5% so not false in that sense. At its peak it was 16.8% in Mar. 2010, and by Dec. 2016 it was sitting at 7.8.So, yeah, I wouldn't attribute it to the Trump Admin.The trend for all unemployment numbers has been going down for a couple years now so Obama gets that credit.  If Trump and R's can actually pass meaningful economic legislation then they will own it. Not gonna stop Trump from taking credit two faced or not: [Reference](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-monthly-jobs-numbers-sean-spicer-235936)Why is anyone crediting economic factors of this level to the president in the first place?

For example, [take this poll showing 120%](http://i.imgur.com/2lHy2yv.gif) or [this one showing 110%](http://i.imgur.com/HSgeCRu.png).  Or how about when they [skew bar graphs](http://i.imgur.com/cOqIECY.png) in order to further their narrative, or [this line chart](http://i.imgur.com/CDBnw9P.png) that puts 8.6% on the same line as 9.0.

Look up how many times they [put a D in front of a disgraced Republican](http://imgur.com/a/pLe42), or show them how they've [photoshopped pictures](http://i.imgur.com/eEouKuy.jpg) to make people look more dastardly.You don't need to worry about liberal sources to show these ""inaccuracies"" when you can get them directly from Fox News.>A common rebuttal made by Fox News adherents to attempted fact-checks of statements is essentially, ""Well, that fact-checking is made using ""Liberal"" sources/studies/experts who are clearly biased and lying, so I reject it outright.""That's just a way of saying, ""I won't listen to any views that I disagree with"".The fact is, any outlet that criticized Fox News regularly, no matter how conservative, would quickly be labeled ""liberal"" and ""unreliable"" by Fox News viewers.There's plenty of criticism of Fox on libertarian outlets like reason.com, but followers of Fox News would just say that they don't count because it's just a website and not a mainstream news organization. And of course, you would have the ""anyone who disagrees with me on gay marriage or immigration must be a liberal"" issue.So much of Fox's daily programming is opinion, by their own admission, that I would hesitate to call them a news outlet.I doubt there is one given that almost definitionally a fact checker would have to be to the right of Fox News in order to be believed and fact checking would tend to be a more centrist undertaking.  I've thought there would be some value in a joint right/left fact checking effort.  Perhaps a model would be AEI and Brookings various joint efforts, I've noticed they've lately had one on [Family Leave](https://www.aei.org/publication/aei-brookings-paid-family-leave-joint-blog-series/) and in the past they had a Joint Center on Regulatory Studies.Does The Onion count as a non-liberal source?"

14,"This isn't really a good fit for this subreddit as it's largely opinion based. However, I'm not really sure where a good spot for it would be. Any suggestions? /r/TrueAskReddit?Many Americans think the rest of the world regards this as their role and that they admire and would like to be like the USA.The truth is, most people would rather the USA keep to itself and stop interfering in the world. We don't admire the greed, we regard the death penalty, the free availability of weapons and the lack of a proper social and health care safety net as barbaric.Basically this is a fascist argument. Because the United States has power it has an obligation to use it for good, gets to define ""good,"" and exists in a de facto position of moral leader. It's the same reason Superman does what he does, really. There is an unspoken assumption that power begets moral superiority. Of course that's not always the case. The United States did involve itself in WW2 and that did end the war faster but the United States also prolonged the war in Vietnam for no real purpose, has toppled no end of legitimate governments in South America to the death and detriment of millions, and has - charitably - been an **amoral** actor in the post cold war period. There probably aren't uncomplicated, black and white answers to most of these sorts of questions. People who act and believe otherwise are fooling themselves, or possibly selling something. In either case, never assume that literally the most complex and high stakes game that human play has simple, reductive solutions. It almost never does.With great power comes great responsibility.We hold these truths to be self-evidence, that *all* men are created equal.I realize this is a late answer, but no one has really answered your question in a very informative or nuanced way. We've had a lot of opinions one way or the other, but not much else.Before I go on:> And that it is no longer the superpower it once was.This is patently false. In every conceivable metric, the United States' military, diplomatic, and economic power remains at the peak of the world by huge margins. A lot of current theses and policy rely, so I need to get that out of the way. Yes, the United States is very much a superpower.Anyway, American foreign policy as the world police or moral police stretches back to a basic conception on the behavior of states in international relations. Essentially, the view is that in a unipolar system where one state is clearly more powerful than others, a challenger state will emerge, typically either by absorbing other states or by allying with other states. The remaining states are desperate for benefits, or spoils in a more classical sense, and join the challenger in competing with the hegemon.A lot of U.S policy following WWII and during the Cold War was to first of all prevent this challenger state from rising and  second secure American supremacy at the top: providing for Japan's military needs and security, for example. Eventually, however, the existent challenger states prevented this strategy from being viable. So, in order to prevent a challenger state from getting the necessary support it would need to compete with the American Hegemon after the Cold War resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States began to establish a policy of Benevolent Hegemony.Essentially, what this means is that, instead of solely focusing on itself or even its own direct interests in some cases, the United States attempts to endear itself to the other states a challenger would need in order to effectively threaten it. The Marshall Plan after World War II was an early version of this strategy: the American government gave out billions of dollars in loans to rebuild European Nations, and as an incentive against joining the Soviet Bloc. Today, the United States spends more money in foreign aid that any other nation, bankrolls NATO and UN operations, and uses its military as a deterring force in global crises. This stretches to acting as the aforementioned ""moral world police"". By acting in this manner, the United States incentivizes countries acting in their common interests rather than joining any challenger states (Russia, China being the largest current ones).Now, to get into the nitty-gritty of your friends' arguments. An isolationist might question why United States supremacy matters, and hope for a world in which states conform maybe to a central supranational body. A neoliberal view not shared by realists, but not necessarily an uncommon one in academia and bureaucracies (don't let my biases influence you). Problem with this mindset of ""who cares about US supremacy?"" Is that we live in a nuclear age. As Einstein said, ""I don't know with what weapons WWIII will be fought, but WWIV will be fought with sticks and stones."" The rise of a challenger with sufficient power to challenge the United States militarily could end in a nuclear war we've been trying to avoid since the damn things' inventions.There's also the Human Rights problem: for example, the case in Rwanda. Following the Black Hawk Down incident in Somalia, the United States under Clinton engaged in a highly isolationist trend in global politics over domestic outcry against foreign engagements. In the wake of this, the event known as the Rwandan Genocide, wherein 800,000 Tutsi Rwandans were murdered, was met with no international intervention until it was too late, as the existing UN peacekeeping force proved unable to stem the genocide.But that doesn't mean that Interventionism is always the answer either. The United States' records in South America during the Cold War, Iraq, and Vietnam have certainly proven this. The fact of the matter is that the United States' position relies on a certain level of intervention, but it continually fails to appreciate the difference in values in some nations where it intervenes.Your friend is wrong.The only thing we have going for us is the world police, the most powerful military. Everything is is far from fact in many American and non American eyes. As far as even the world police goes, we should use that term loosely for we could also be easily viewed as a mafia. So many countries need help, from the cartel in Mexico to various countries in Africa, but we all suddenly wish to spread democracy with countries only  that serve special interests with us, by spreading democracy I mean placing another dictator in the last dictator's place and hope he plays puppet. As far as this topic goes, there is a lot of game theory going on in the heads of CIA, the military, and politics. Among that game theory is uneducated biases, old outdated techniques or habits, and greed. How far these qualities go is purely speculation or conspiracy theory, but as information gets more and more available, we learn conspiracy theorists are closer to the truth than anyone else is no matter how crazy they are. No government should be trusted to have the people's best interests, especially one that claims to be the most powerful and has the statistics to back it up. That's why the people should always be invested in politics, something the American education does not teach its citizens properly how."
15,"If someone knows where ro pull the data, ill code itThe cost of White House travel is reviewed by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), but usually at the request of another government body, not on a continual basis. The Senate requested information on President Obama's travel expenses last year and the GAO issued a [report in October.](http://www.gao.gov/assets/690/680400.pdf) Recent press has extrapolated the numbers from that report to estimate what President Trump has spent.Yesterday on French tv they said that since being in office he spend 69 hours playing golf."
17,"Not sure what parts you want checked, as your post title alone references two unrelated thongs and the article rambles on and on without one clear thesis to support or refute.Based on the source alone however, I don't trust the Epich Times as far as I can throw them. They are owned and operated by the Falun Gong, and have an ""iffy"" relationship to the facts, to say the least.This article is trash. I wouldn't trust this publication, and I use that word loosely, to reliably report the color of the sky.I do agree with the comments in this thread that you need to be clearer what you want fact checked here. However, just condemning the Epoch Times as ""fake news"" will quickly be dismissed by anyone you argue against as an ad hominem attack. So I wouldn't make that argument. If someone presents this type of article to you, the best thing to do is deconstruct it point-to-point, and then try to determine what the agenda, if any, the writer has. Since you seem to be looking for refutations, and none have been provided, I'll give you some examples.In this case, there is a very obvious bias toward the Trump administration, as well as *against* the Clintons. The article more or less says flat out that the Clintons are the ones we should be looking at for wrongdoing, even though they have nothing to do with the clickbait-y title, or the premise of the article.They also cherry pick info from other articles and publications, taking it out of context to make it look like their sources support their arguments. For example, the article says:>According to PolitiFact, some critics of the Clintons suggest the speaking fee “might have been an attempt by Renaissance Capital to curry favor with the State Department,” since Renaissance Capital was involved in a deal to obtain Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada but with operations in the United States, that supplied close to 11 percent of U.S. uranium in 2014.First off, they link Politifact, pulling a quote beginning, ""some critics of the Clintons suggest..."", which is utter nonsense. They're making it look like Politifact supports their claim, when they're simply fact-checking claims by a party that is clearly anti-Clinton. This is blatantly misleading. If you read the Politifact article, it goes on to state:>In 2010, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, was one of nine federal agency heads to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada with operations in several U.S. states. It was part of a regular process for approving international deals involving strategic assets, such as uranium, that could have implications for national security. Uranium One’s U.S. mines produced about 11 percent of the country’s total uranium production in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.But even with its control of Uranium One, Russia cannot export the material from the United States. Russia was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer.As PolitiFact and others have detailed, some investors with an interest in making the Uranium One deal go through have a long-time relationship with Bill Clinton and have donated to the Clinton Foundation. But there’s no concrete evidence those relationships or donations helped make the deal go through. Most of the donations occurred before Hillary Clinton could have known she would become secretary of state. And again, the secretary of state was one of nine agency heads that had input into the final decision, which ultimately lay with President Barack Obama.This clearly doesn't fit the agenda of the article, as it more or less debunks the notion that the Clintons have some sort of back channel deal to sell US uranium to Russia. Rather than laying out the entirety of the facts, they just move on to other cherry-picked quote from other sources that they claim validate their assertions. Overall, it's not the worst article a conservative might use for an argument, but it is certainly biased, and does nothing convince me of any of their claims. Most of what they say about there not being evidence for collusion comes from people not tied to the current investigations, people on Trump's side, or simply people who just don't know about any evidence because the investigations aren't over, and haven't made their findings public yet. So yes, the article is largely irrelevant. It's well-researched and sourced trash, but trash all the same."
18,"The general rule with your online data is that ~3 pieces of personal identifying information can be used to map out the entirety of your online presence. Your ip address, last name, and your shoe size. [Not any three will do, hence the ""~"". Obviously ""full name"" and ""age"" will do fine for some people.] These 3 pieces of data are used to confirm you at the exclusion of everyone else on the internet. The other identifying information present along with these 3 pieces of data create links to larger and larger sets of data, until a full and complete picture of your online presence can be mapped out. This is a primarily deductive rather than inductive exercise. However, all that disparate information is captured when it first leaves your house; that's your ISP. The likelihood that your ISP has enough to deduce who you are from the other people with your external IP is close to 100% if you've ever bought anything. All personally identifying information you've ever shared is stored with your ISP in one convenient location. No mapping required.

And, equally, Wikileaks hasn't become the shill of the Russian government, its become the shill of the CIA.If that's the case, the CIA should just be going along with Trump rather than offering any push-back to him.

23,"My daughter has cystic fibrosis. Her medication costs about $40,000/yr, and most years she has a 3-10 day hospital stay. Without this medication and this care, she would be dead before her 25th birthday. With proper care, life expectancy for a person with CF is about 40, and there are some patients who are over 60.When my daughter was born, I was the sole income earner for our family of 3, making $15/hr. We did not qualify for medicare in the state of Arizona.Where I worked, the company-provided insurance had a maximum payout of $10,000/yr. After that, employees were on their own.Fortunately, my daughter was born 7 months after the ACA was passed, so we could buy insurance on the open market. Before the ACA, no insurance company would cover a person with CF. It was literally impossible to buy insurance.I now work for an employer that provides a comprehensive plan that keeps my total costs for my daughter's care under $6,000/yr. That cost is likely to go up somewhat as the GOP seeks to reduce the tax benefit that my employer gets for providing a good plan. Also, I understand that others are not so fortunate.Without the ACA, many Americans will be restricted as to whom they can work for, where they can live, and whether they can start a business. Negatively impacting employment flexibility and entrepreneurship negatively impacts the economy.Also, many charities like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation spend some of their money on research, and some on assisting patients pay for their care. The more money that we withdraw from patients, the less they have to conduct research. I hate to think of what might have happened to my little girl  without the ACA. God damn Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and the rest of the Republicans in congress for taking life-saving medication away from kids like my little girl so that they can have a political talking point and to finance a [400 million dollar giveaway](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/400-million-dollar-tax-break-for-insurance-execs-sparks-outrage.html) to a bunch of millionaires.EDIT: By coincidence, there was recently a couple of studies which show that cystic fibrosis patients [live an average of 10 years longer](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/cystic-fibrosis-canada-vs-us-survival-study/) in Canada than they do in the US.Many possible factors were given, but this tidbit really stands out:>When CF patients in the USA registry with Medicaid or Medicare were excluded from the analysis, leaving the patients with private insurance or 'other', the difference between Canada and the US disappeared.So saying, ""the old system was OK, and patients who have chronic conditions or low incomes can just use Medicare and Medicaid"" just doesn't stand up to reality. Returning to the pre-ACA days of denying private insurance to patients with chronic conditions results in premature deaths, full stop. In the absence of a single-payer or government run system, we need to ensure that everyone has the resources to buy private insurance plans, and that  private insurers are not allowed to turn people away. Unfortunately, the only way to do that is to mandate that everyone is required to have insurance coverage.It was really bad. 1. All healthcare cost, as it does now, hundreds of thousands of dollars for any significant care. This could routinely bankrupt families without insurance. 2. If you had a private plan (ie, not provided by work) you had a lifetime cap of about $5million. This means that a premature baby could run out his lifetime cap before ever coming home from the hospital. 3. If you had any significant medical issues you could be denied coverage AT ANY PRICE. This policy was uniform across the industry, a preexisting condition made you pretty much uninsurable. 4. Many of these issues could be resolved by getting a job with a health benefit. There was no retirement that employers provide such a benefit. 5. Recision was a common practice. Insurance companies would routinely go back over applications looking for indications of the presence of s preexisting condition once someone made a (frequently unrelated) claim even years after signing up and use the preexisting condition to retroactively cancel coverage. Usually without refunding premiums paid. Yea, it was pretty bad.I'd say it is best to look at everything that was brought out by the ACA. This can be found on https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/02/fact-sheet-affordable-care-act-healthy-communities-six-years-later   While I think it was a great idea and am for it, I did not like the plan itself.

I remember getting into a discussion with someone who worked for hospital accounting said this was a problem.They where not political, and we where discussing cost of medicine pre-ACA (it wasn't part of the discussion).It came about because I was talking about how cheap medicine is in other countries.Here's some interesting quotes:>Additionally, about 54% of physicians knew other doctors who were reluctant to help an injured person while off-duty because of a fear of liability. Of those 54%, 34% of those physicians knew of a specific situation where a doctor did not volunteer to help. Moreover, 76% of physicians reported that their concerns about malpractice litigation hurt their own ability to provide quality patient care.  A majority of physicians, hospital administrators, and nurses believe that unnecessary or excessive care was sometimes provided because of the fear of medical liability, and many believe this happened ""very often."">The most common physician policies provide $1 million of coverage per incident and $3 million of coverage per year.I personally don't think getting rid of this is a good 'solution', as the hospitals won't just adjust things back. ""Once you pay Danegeld...""I do think it is important to consider when you realize that a hospital can staff 100+ doctors. Paying for the insurance is a significant number.It was pretty good 20 years ago. My employer covered almost all of my insurance for me and my wife. It was about then that the Federal Government started certain mandates that drove the costs through the roof. The less the government is involved the more the free market can compete to drive the prices down. Obamacare (and this wasn't the start of it - it actually started under the Clinton administration) created a new entitlement. Regrettably once you start a new entitlement it's close to impossible to get rid of it no matter how destructive it is.>  in a discussion where a user stated that ""only 10% of people could legitimately not afford the cost"". That person is an idiot.  Some numbers here including historical numbers going back to 2009.  http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/health-insurance-premiums.aspxA person making 30,000 a year (right at but above the poverty line) who didn't get insurance from their employer could in no way afford a yearly plan that cost $9000 let alone just $1200 which would give you basically nothing.  They need that $1200 to squander it on rent, food, and heat.> How was the healtcare system pre-ACA?Those outside of getting insurance through their employer had to pay very high premiums.  Premiums for everyone, even employers, was going up very fast - even double digits some years.  After ACA, premiums continued to rise but more slowly.  With the expansion of Medicaid and the subsidies we now have more people with health insurance than **ever before**.  While cost is still an issue and the rise in premiums is still an issue... the ACA was still a resounding success.  [It would have been even better with the so-called ""public option"" which was killed due to Republican opposition.]> Was it really not so bad as people thought?Well... by some estimates 20,000 to 45,000 people died each year due to lack of healthcare.  So, it was worse... much worse than most want to admit.The reason so many people are clueless on this is that the vast majority of people (something like 70%) get their insurance from their employer.  Before ACA the costs were transparent (if not entirely invisible) to them.  After the ACA... again the costs were transparent and so to them little, if anything, changed.  But for those outside employer based insurance... the ACA was a life saver (literally in many cases) and not just because of the abolition of pre-existing conditions.Here is my favorite explainer on the topic: https://mises.org/blog/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive"
24,"While I think these points are great, Trump may be referencing the cost of the current system that allows legal immigration and also seeks to stop illegal immigration. If this is the case, then we're talking about the cost of operating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).In this [DHS 2016 budget] (https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/FY_2016_DHS_Budget_in_Brief.pdf), between ICE and CBP, thats about 18 billion currently. (Page 10)."
26,"saying that all ""liberals"" are PC policing SJWs based on fringe groups is like saying all ""conservatives"" are racist white evangelists because of their fringe groups.""PC"" and ""crude"" aren't mutually exclusive.Liberals in particular have always liked ""subversive"" art far more than conservatives. It's because most liberals / leftists are high in the ""openness"" big-5 personality trait, so they crave novel and exciting experiences far more than their conservative counter-parts who are lower in openness.""PC"" doesn't mean ""don't be crude"", it means ""participate in our ideology"". The PC ideology is, roughly speaking, a binary view of the world which splits everyone into either prey or predator groups. So if the words on TV are crude but don't harm anyone in the ""prey"" category, they're more than happy to enjoy the humor just as much as any liberal. However if the language is construed as an attack by the predator against the prey, they see it as unnecessarily cruel and they react by trying to defend the so-called prey against the mean words.In other words it's not the crudeness itself but rather the *target* of the crudeness that sets them off. This is in stark contrast to traditional conservatives of yesteryear who viewed crudeness itself as a kind of degredation of a person's moral fabric. For them the moral outrage was far more centered around the way that the jokes ""ruffled their feathers"", so to speak, and caused a kind of inner chaos. Their fear was that this chaos - which people who are low in openness really hate - would become normalized, and that all the orderliness in society would become harder to maintain.Also I agree with the point that there's a whole specrtrum of liberals AND conservatives, and saying that they all behave just one way is wrong. In my post here I'm definitely referring more to the fringe elements.Not really:https://www.reddit.com/r/southpark/comments/5kkx73/south_parks_popularity_across_the_usa/The show seems to be mostly popular in areas that have a lot of white people, so it's less popular in the deep south. There's also a trend toward being popular in larger cities.They probably got that from this somewhat recent NY Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html?_r=0Even if it is true, remember that correlation does not mean causation. There is a strong correlation between number of movies Nick Cage is in every year and the number of people who drown in a swimming pool that year, and (hopefully) those numbers are in no way related. In addition, another comment pointed out that it is more popular in large cities, which is where more liberals live. That does not mean, one way or the other, that liberals are the ones doing the watching."
27,"[removed]Mods, is this as good as it gets here? I'm trying to make an informed decision about unsubscribing.One of the leaks was the he was having, 10,000 National Guard officers round up illegals.        Which btw was a  purposeful leak to see where it was coming from"
29,"You're right in saying that he's misrepresenting the general trend by cherry-picking statistics, so if you want validation from anyone on your thinking you've got it.The rape case takes a bit of explaining. First of all, I'm assuming this guy was trying to make the argument that crime spiked when They let in refugees, yes? Well, I know for a fact that the Swedish government doesn't mark religious affiliation or ethnic group when charging a person with a crime (or at least don't release this publicly), so already we have a problem of correlation and not causation.Second, we have the actual statistics. According to Swedish Criminal Statistics, [rape charges have actually gone down since 2014.](https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/rape-and-sex-offences.html) As Horowitz would tell you, however, this is a single year in a decade-long trend of rape incidents increasing. However, this number is artificially inflated by a change in Swedish Law on rape implemented in 2005. Essentially what changed is that in Sweden, each instance of rape against a single victim can be used as a separate charge levied against the accused rapist as opposed to several rapes against a single victim being charged as one count of rape, as it is in other countries. This, in conjunction with the government broadening the legal definition of rape to cover acts that might previously be classified as sexual assault or exploitation in other countries, has caused the number of charges to increase dramatically since then. You can read all this in the Swedish report, though Horowitz seems to have left that part out in his explorations.If you look slightly down the report at the number of convictions due to sex offenses, though, you'll see the rate is pretty stable barring a small spike in 2010-2011. There are two ways to look at this: Either the justifications provided by the Swedish government are correct and charges have simply increased on the same number of people, or (for the conspiracy theorists) the Swedish judicial system is convicting fewer rapists because they worship political correctness or something equally ludicrous.One thing I have heard is people wondering why the conviction rate is the same when more charges for rape are adding up. It's good to remind them that the chart for number of convictions is based on all sexual offenses, which would not change as the new rape definition absorbed other sexual crimes.And no, unfortunately I can't find a chart for 2016, but I think it's fairly easy to see that the argument is relying on an incredible amount of statistical gymnastics to sound even halfway plausible.EDIT: Clarity regarding Swedish Law.There was a recent  big outcry from the right wing blogosphere (example [this link](https://bearingarms.com/jenn-j/2017/02/20/trumps-remarks-sweden-validated/) and many others) about a police Chief Stefan Sinteus in Malmo Sweden,who sent a letter to the government with a report of a  massive crime wave of multiple shootings and grenades being thrown.  The town Malmo might have a large immigrant population. If you go to Swedish newspapers the problem he was encountering was a large part of his police force was off on vacation or they had open positions for officers and he needed more money to hire more staff.   [This report was from July 2015:](http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21183619.ab) >Half the police force in Malmo - despite the wave of violenceThe police is on its knees after wave of shootings and grenade attacks>NYHETERtis July 28, 2015Malmo shaken by a series of grenade attacks and shootings.Despite the cut in half the police force in the city during the summer.- It's only a matter of time before someone in the public will be harmed, says union president Sophia Will Anderson to Sydsvenskan.In recent weeks, six grenade attacks occurred in Malmo. In summer the city has also been plagued by 30 shootouts.But despite the violence has Malmö's police force has been halved. It reports Sydsvenskan. Normally, the police force consists of 705 people. Police Union says that a third of them are on holiday, without being replaced by substitutes. Alongside this are many parental leave or reassigned to non-police tasks.""Felt by the business""The strained personnel situation, making the prospects of resolving the violent crimes are bad. It says Sophia Will Anderson, president of the Police Association Southern Region.- Many of the crimes will not be solved because of the severe understaffing, she said to Sydsvenskan.Police chief Stefan Sinteus admits that the situation is serious:- It is clear that it is sensible for the business.People may be damagedPolice officers have turned to the Police Federation and said that investigations closed down because of the staffing situation. According to the union means staff lack a danger to the public.- It's only a matter of time before someone in the public will be damaged. There is chance that has brought so far, says Sophia Will Anderson to Sydsvenskan.Whether this was an actual crime wave and whether immigrants were part of it is unclear. If there was bedlam, there sure is a paucity of news stories after this July article.  Right now the only major story in Malmo recently is about [gang violence](http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/JeEmX/mycket-ovanligt-att-allmanheten-drabbas-av-skottlossning) and a couple of shootings which included a [16 year old boy.](http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/zKr24/skottlossning-i-malmo--tonarspojke-dod) Again no mention of immigrants. It's unclear if that is official policy not to give out that type of identifying information.It looks like the right wing are desperate to find stories to back their narrative about bad immigrants, but it looks like it's overblown in the Swedish references."

31,"How about a link to an actual claim or details. You know, little things like when & where?Guled Haysow Mohamud, born in 1997, was 17 when he raped the 12-year-old girl. He was 18 when convicted of rape of a child (*våldtäkt mot barn*). The district court reported that he raped her and hit her in the face and head. Among other things, the victim suffered from severe genital bleeding. The court also writes that he had reason to assume she was under 15 (which is the age of consent in Sweden). He was sentenced to 180 hours of community service. Article from a reputable source (SVT): [Raped 12-year-old Girl](http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vasternorrland/valdtog-12-arig-flicka-2)  [Court ruling](https://www.scribd.com/doc/269591579/Sundsvalls-TR-dom)According to the Swedish Penal Code, Chapter 6, Section 4(1), such rape should result in a conviction of at least two and at maximum six years.  Notably, rape rarely leads to conviction in Sweden and this is just one among many similar events. Numerous horror stories about crimes in Sweden that have recently been used and spun in American media have at base been correct.Shit like this just heightens fear in those that only look at ""headlines"". But welcome to America!"
32,"American Action forum a right wing think tank that runs a Super PAC which promotes goals of a republican house majority.This isn't even economics, it's a partisan political hackjob.Eakins talks about labour participation rate down 3%. Which is due to people leaving the labour market... primarily because baby boomers keep retiring. Only right wing spin jobs use that number to attack Obamas excellent unemployment numbers.Everything coming from this place is right wing spin.My guess is he will be remembered for saving a disastrous economy that was in freefall. If Obama had received the robust economy W did and then only achieved 2% it would be more notable.If a pilot loses 3 engines 1000 miles from the nearest airport and lands the plane on a highway no one remembers the flight for having a landing that was slightly more bumpy than normal.I also think Obama will be remembered for saving the US auto industry, killing Osama Bin Laden and Obama care (if it survives - maybe even if it doesn't)The fact is accurate, but the implication (that this is terrible and we should be doing much better) probably isn't. As developed as the U.S. economy is, a steady 2% growth is probably about as good as we can really hope for. We're not going to match the rate of growth of developing countries like China and India. Anytime we've gone much beyond 2% in the past few decades was because of a unique circumstance (the birth of the internet) or bubbles like in tech and housing that aren't healthy. The real question many economists are dealing with is whether we actually have any grounds for expecting constant long-term growth, or if the U.S. economy should be expected to plateau or start contracting eventually.On the radio today I heard a conservative pundit make the claim that growth under Obama was the weakest since WW2. He failed to mention that we had just gone through the second worst recession in the history of the US. I think that's applicable here.""I suppose he’s using year-over-year data, with which the claim is true but misleading,"" Princeton economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact Florida. Blinder and another Princeton economics professor, David Watson, examined GDP growth during presidential administrations in a July 2014 study.There are any number of historical vagaries that color what affects GDP during any administration, Obama included. Obama has overseen the country climbing out of a historical recession that left the housing market depressed, wages low, and businesses wary of investing. He’s also had a Congress that has largely pushed an austerity agenda against his wishes. And global crises like instability in the Middle East and slowed growth in China and Europe have lowered demand for U.S. products and pushed the dollar higher.""The fact that the economy has steadily improved is actually fairly remarkable, considering what else has been happening,"" said Christian Weller, a University of Massachusetts Boston public policy professor and a fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Annual figures on GDP growth goes back to 1929, and often is used to back up the same talking point on conservative media outlets that Obama has not had a full calendar year of aggregate GDP growth of at least 3 percent.U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows Herbert Hoover, who was inaugurated in March 1929 and left office in March 1933, was the last president to have this distinction. Hoover presided over an economy mired in the Great Depression that shrank during his term.Every president since then has seen at least one calendar year with annual GDP growth of at least 3 percent or higher. The best average growth in a single calendar year under Obama is 2.6 percent in 2015, and never 3 percent or more. No president has experienced that since Hoover.But experts said Trump’s use of ""modern history"" is vague, and using the annual change in GDP is perhaps not the best measure. The best data goes back to 1947, when the federal government started tracking GDP by quarter.That would give a more nuanced picture of the data — the economy in the first quarter of a presidency is often attributed to the preceding administration, for example. It also would coincide with the historical boom in the nation’s economy after World War II.Going by quarters, growth within a year was higher than 3 percent during two periods during Obama’s presidency, Blinder said. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was 3.4 percent. From the first quarters of 2014 and of 2015, it was 3.3 percent.Overall growth rates for several administrations have exceeded 3 percent, but Weller said context is important.Without complete data for 2016, the average growth rate during Obama’s two terms was 2 percent, Weller said. That was on par with George H.W. Bush’s term and faster than George W. Bush’s average.Also this piece by politifact provides more context on the issue.Douglas Holtz-Eakin was John McCain's economic adviser for his 2008 campaign, chair of the Congressional Budget Office under George W. Bush and a senior staff economist on George H.W Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. One can easily conclude that he is a partisan Republican, and which explains his use of economic data points to show the Obama administration in a bad light.[Real quarterly GDP figures via the St Louis Fed's FRED tool](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).2016Q4 was $16,804.8bn annualized (all figures in chained 2009 dollars), 2008Q4 was $14,577bn, thus giving an average annual real GDP growth rate over Obama's two terms = 32 quarters of (16,804.8 / 14,577.0)^(4/32) - 1 = 1.8%.  For context, under Reagan it was 3.6%, under Bush 41 2.2%, under Clinton 3.8%, and under Bush 43 1.8%.In the video Holtz-Eakin does, however, specifically point to the 2% figure as being since ""then"", referring to the time since the Great Recession.  The last quarter of the Great Recession was 2009Q2 when real annualized GDP had fallen to $14,355.6bn, and so the real GDP growth rate from then to the end of Obama's time in office was (16,804.8 / 14,355.6)^(4/30) - 1 = 2.1%.  It's not unreasonable to round that to 2%.So the first claim is true.  How significant a part of Obama's legacy it will be is something that'll have to await the conclusions of future historians.Obama's and that of his Democratic Congress. Am I right?!It will look rosy compared to Trumps -5% (or -50%)."
33,"Daniel Dale at the Toronto Star is keeping a [running fact-checked list here](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/03/daniel-dales-donald-trump-fact-check-updates.html).

34,"TL;DR: False, but there is some basis for the sentiment he's expressing.This [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/how-long-confirmations-will-take/) article seems to give a good breakdown (the WSJ article /u/Panic_at_the_WinCo posted requires a subscription, so I can't look at it).It's difficult to judge ""longest delay"" given different number of cabinet members confirmed at different dates. For example, Obama had 6 confirmed on day 1 and 11 confirmed by this time. However, Obama also had 3 rejected and his last cabinet member wasn't confirmed until late April.However, Trump's claim is ""my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country."" According to The Washington Post, none of the last four presidents had their full cabinet in place until at least mid-March. So, no, it's not close to the longest delay for a full cabinet.In Trump's defense, though, each of those presidents also had significantly more cabinet members confirmed at this time.EDIT: Here's [some more from 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/obama-has-waited-longer-for-cabinet-confirmations-than-any-other-recent-president/) on this. Obama's nominees waited an average of 35 days before confirmation. Note that we're at day 18 of Trump's presidency, now.And this is all compounded by the fact that [Trump only had about half of his cabinet nominees even picked when he was inaugurated](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-senate-confirmations-slog-233726), he's picked a bunch of very rich individuals for whom going through their ethics and financial disclosures take a lot longer, and [at least one has yet to even file his paperwork](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hearing-for-labor-secretary-nominee-delayed-group-sues-to-open/article_aa40d6f1-c813-5d3a-8f99-6f9252b8cecc.html).So the implication that delays are due to Democrat obstructionism definitely seems to have some basis given the news in the past couple weeks, but definitely overlook at lot of mitigating factors.I think it is irrelevant how much validity that statement has.  What is relevant is why they have been held up.  Trumps *modus operandi* is distraction.  Him pointing to delays are really just a distraction from the real problem.  The reason for these historic delays is that he is putting people in place that are either completely unqualified and/or paid their way in.  Betsy DeVos for example has 0 years teaching and 0 years in school administration, yet was appointed the head of the Department of Education.  What she is, is an activist that has funneled millions of dollars into the campaigns of republicans that approved her appointment.  Scott Pruitt the nominee for the EPA is someone that does not seem to think pollution actually exists and believes the EPA is useless.  Trump literally nominated a head to a government agency that believes that government agency is pointless.  What is historic is the level of incompetence with which the appointments are being made.http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/Bush Sr.'s Veteran Affairs pick was not confirmed until more than 5 weeks after inauguration.False: And its not even close.https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/obama-has-waited-longer-for-cabinet-confirmations-than-any-other-recent-president/Measuring by number of days since a nomination was submitted, Obama had to wait far longer for several nominees."
35,"While the facts themselves are definitely unbiased, the absence or omittion of facts in contextualizing a political statement can illustrate bias. Bias can exist both in which topics are chosen to discuss as well as the amount of effort applied to vetting particular topics. For example, subreddits like /r/srs and /r/shitpoliticssays cherry-pick examples of statements made which conflict with their particular worldview. these aren't ""biased"" facts, they're quotations; nothing could be further from bias. but, how these statements are chosen and organized indicate bias, through criticism of an ideology via straw man arguments. one person says something dumb and it's generalized to all people of that particular ideology. similarly, a completely unbiased fact checking website would be difficult, as any omittion of facts could be seen as bias...it's easier to identify a clearly biased factchecking review, by finding clear signs of affirming the consequent, appeals to emotion, red herrings, straw men, or other logical fallacies presented as facts in defense of a given statement. Ive seen some good and some bad factchecks on every site; your best bet is to learn the qualities of a poor factcheck and make the decision for yourself. there are online courses to identify common logical fallacies that make a huge positive difference in this regard. .#bowlinggreen .#thoughtsandprayers""Facts"" are neither true nor false, they simply are. People do dispute the facts however.""Bias"" as it relates to truth is the degree to which any statement or claim deviates from the truth. Truth is determined by evaluating a proposition or argument for it's validity and soundness. If the premises are true and the argument is formally valid then the conclusion must *necessarily* follow from the premises and the argument is said to be sound.However, in the media many arguments are not valid, they commit one fallacy or another. Their premises are often dubious at best and the argument is not logically valid and therefore we cannot draw the conclusion that we are asked to make.That is how you evaluate any claim or argument made by anyone anywhere at any time. There is no other and it applies to so-called fact checking sites as well as any other media outlet.I appreciate that the sites aren't totally binary and try to account for context a little in their rulings, but because that is somewhat interpretative i believe their is a bit of inherent bias. This doesn't make the fact check worthless, though.A good fact check walks you through the whole argument and the related data; that way you can draw your own conclusion, even if it differs from their own ruling.Neither site has a left/right bias.Politifact, if anything, has a bias towards being objectively and factually correct.  They look for statements to verify that can be  proven or disproven within a small time frame.  For example, they once did a check on whether OSHA regulated toilet seats, but I doubt would do a check on whether OSHA auditors were the most efficient government employees.Snopes would have similar pressures as a small independent journalist outfit.I think ""fact-checking"" journalism is inherently flawed.  For one, if they were really validating factual claims, all of these sites would have a binary rating system: true or false.  The fact that fact checks rely on a spectrum where ""mostly true"" or ""two Pinocchio's"" exists illustrates that the system is a farce.Going by examples is a difficult proposition.  Either we have to quibble over whether a given statement is ""half-true"" or we have to find identical situations with different outcomes to demonstrate bias.  The former is a complete waste of time\*, and the latter is extremely difficult for two reasons.  First, we need a lot of published fact-checks before we can find identical situations (and even then we aren't guaranteed any).  Second, assuming we do find these situations, they can be brushed off as anecdotal evidence that fail to demonstrate a consistent bias.  Perhaps the most illustrative and well-known incident comes from PolitiFact.  Ron Paul claimed that the federal income tax rate was 0% prior to 1913.  He got rated [half true](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/jan/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-federal-income-tax-rate-was-0-percen/).  Jim Webb says we didn't have a federal income tax until 1913 and got a [mostly true](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/aug/24/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-us-didnt-have-income-taxes-until-191/).  Someone must have pointed this out to them, because they just revised the rating to bring it in line with Paul's.  Which begs the question: if they are objective, how did the same claim get a different rating?  How could one analysis have two acceptable ratings?A second example I can think of goes back to Obamacare.  In [2009](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-promises-you-can-keep-your-health-ins/) and [2012](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/) Politifact rated ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" as half true.  Then in 2013, it was declared [lie of the year](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/).  How can the same claim have two very different ratings?  Because in 2009 and 2012 they were evaluating speculative claims and in 2013 they weren't.  I won't expand on this point because James Taranto did a [much better job](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303932504579256300070093302) at the time than I can.Matt Shapiro recently attempted to do a high-level data-driven analysis of PolitiFact.  He scraped PolitiFact's website for just the raw data and published his findings in a 3 part series ([1](http://theparadoxproject.org/blog-1/2016/12/4/mostly-false-politifact-and-bias) [2](http://theparadoxproject.org/blog-1/2016/12/20/picking-your-fact-politifacts-biased-fact-check-choices) [3](http://theparadoxproject.org/blog-1/2016/12/21/donald-trump-the-democrat-how-trump-exposes-politifacts-bias)).  I think if you start from the premise that it's impossible for a fact-checker to not be biased, then Shapiro does a pretty thorough job demonstrating that PolitiFact is biased against Republicans.  His work wasn't well disseminated because he's relatively unknown, so I haven't seen any rebuttals.  I would be interested in seeing that.\*I'm gonna do it anyway.  While looking for something else, I found the time Politifact rated Ryan's claim that ""6 studies say numbers work out"" as false because they didn't [like the studies](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/ryan-says-six-studies-say-math-works-romney-tax-pl/).  Politifact moves the goalposts from 6 studies to 6 independent studies and then declares Ryan missed.With regard to PolitiFact specifically, I think they have a reputation for being more biased than they really are, but it's also sort of their own fault. They make a valiant effort to condense complex issues into simple ratings, and heavily market and display those ratings for everyone to see--but the ratings are usually the least reliable part of their stories. PolitiFact does great journalism and has a lot of very intelligent people on its payroll. If you read their full articles, you'll find tons of meticulously researched, well-structured arguments, but the ratings themselves are much more subjective. Most of the statements they look at are not simply true or false, and one person's ""Mostly True"" could be another's ""Mostly False"", especially if it has to do with the statement being wrong on the details but right in the big picture or vice versa. For example, take one of their latest articles, which looks at Bernie Sanders' claim that the ACA reduced the number of uninsured people in West Virginia by 20 percentage points. There are so many ways one could rate that, given the evidence that PolitiFact provides. True: he cited a relevant study and accurately described the causal relationship between the ACA and the number of uninsured people. Mostly True: he cited a study with a few problems, and the real number might be different, but his overall argument is still accurate.Half True: a more reliable study showed that it dropped by 11 percentage points, not 20. He's close, but not correct. Mostly False: more reliable sources paint a different picture. He might have a point, but his numbers were all wrong.False: he innaccurately cited a study that isn't statistically valid; the words he spoke were just plain wrong. All those ratings are solidly grounded in the truth. He slightly goofed when describing the study, the study isn't statistically significant, and a better study has a different number, but he only misstated the facts of the study slightly, and his overall argument is valid regardless of what sources he used. The PolitiFact writer chose to call it Mostly True. What would you have chosen?judge for yourself: http://www.politifactbias.com/"
36,"the first amendmentyou cannot choose your nationality, but you can choose your religion, which would suggest that a ban on nationality is actually *more* unethical or whatever than a ban on religion. however, these ""investigations"" likely involved a review of your family and their religious affiliation, which is equally uncontrollable as your nationality and thus equally reprehensible on their face.furthermore, i think it may also speak to the intent of the ban and its effect on similar peoples in the country where the ban takes place. a ban against foreigners of a nationality would in theory regulate discrimination to people of that nationality, which would be a much smaller group than if the discrimination of people were to an entire religion. history speaks to the prevalence of discrimination present in nations with bans like this, which lends justification for this as a possible argument against a religious ban.no where in history can i think of examples where bans like this had a positive impact on the affected community, and not many where the ban had a positive impact on the nation doing the banning. but that part is not relevant to your question.Yet, muslims are still allowed to immigrate to the US... what an effective ban!If you want a purely ethical argument, then here's mine. Banning from a nation has more ground to work with. Banning from a nation can be a ban from a government as well as a region. Take Iran for example. They're a fairly ""stable"" region in the Middle East however their government is adamantly anti-American. Ban on them prevents, well makes it harder, for them to send one of the wonderful jihadi groups they prop up with the intention of blowing up a building. Whereas if you look at an area like Syria, the region is completely unstable (and for a moment let's pretend the government is pro-American) which opens an opportunity for extremists to break through or take advantage of the chaos. Both of these provide risks. Religion on the other hand is a complete gamble. Everyone adheres to different tenants of whatever religion they believe in. On top of that there is no type of registration with religion like there is with country. If you want to travel from the US, you need a US passport. There is no equivalent with religion and a person's beliefs are fluid in nature. Ethically speaking, targeting a country or region is targeting situation and circumstance, not a person(s). In order to target a religion, you necessarily have to target individuals and people while ignoring situation and circumstance."
37,"Not a lawyer, but I saw a comment of the following:>Based on the EO, I think someone up there was paying attention. Chief Strategist is invited to NSC as an attendee, rather than identified as a member. He is listed as a member of the Principals Committee, but that doesn't require Senate confirmation. Those individuals serve at the discretion of POTUS.

38,"It has the citations right on it. Are you asking others to look up those citations for you? Or is your post asking to fact check those citations?I always find this type of thing slightly disingenuous. If you picked 9/11 as the beginning date, you would come to completely different conclusions about what the biggest dangers are. They're specially excluding the biggest terrorist attack. It's cherry picking data.Those afraid of terrorism are not afraid of an everyday occurrence, they're afraid of a 9/11 like occurrence. Edit: For the record, I think terrorism is way overrated as a possible cause of death for your average American. The FBI and police seem to be handling everything very well here in the US, and I think *the extreme measures taken in the last week are irrational, unjustified, dangerous, and counter productive.*Edit2: this post suddenly got attention so I'm going to link to [someone smarter than me who argues the point better than me.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/31/terrorists-vs-chairs-an-outlier-story/)TL;DR: It's accurate judging by numbers from similar sources looking at a shorter period.The last number (gunshot homicides) generally matches up with [538's number](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/). They're not doing a 10 year average so it doesn't match up perfectly. But the average should be right where the chart shows unless 2016 fell way outside the norm.First first three seem to match up with the [University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?expanded=yes&casualties_type=&casualties_max=&success=yes&country=217&ob=GTDID&od=desc&page=1&count=20#results-table). Again, they don't give a 10 year average, and they don't include 2016, so I can only say that the 10 year average looks pretty close to where it should be looking at 2014-2015. 2015 is also high for both Islamic terrorism and white-nationalist terrorism, given the Charleston shooting and the San Bernardo shooting, but it seems to average out with 2014."
39,"I'm curious what the 325,000 refers to. I wondered if perhaps that's how many total international arrivals there were on that day. [These data](http://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2016-I-001/table1.asp) (from 2016) suggest we could expect around 180,000 international travelers to arrive in the U.S. per day in January. That number is nowhere close to 325,000, and it's not particularly helpful anyway -- it includes persons arriving by land and by boat as well as by air. But what it does suggest is that the 325,000 is way too high to represent what I'll broadly call ""international visitors"" arriving via air on that day.If I'm reading these [passenger data](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/US%20International%20Air%20Passenger%20and%20Freight%20Statistics%20Report%20for%20March%202015.pdf) (PDF) correctly, there were an average of around 500,000 passengers on international flights per day in January 2015. I'm not sure if that includes arrivals and departures, or just one way. Regardless, unless passenger numbers were really low on that day, it's hard to fit the 325,000 in here.I don't have any more time right now to track down data. Hopefully this is a start for somebody.DHS as reported by [Reuter](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-chaos-idUSKBN15C0LD)s quotes 375 people affected and 109 detained at about the 24 hour mark after it was enacted.  I cannot find a printed source directly from DHS on this.>The Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States.

That being said, this is one source so unclear how reliable.Trump is Putin's Pee Pee Pussy Puppet. Pathetic.

40,"""Bad""  can't be fact-checked, as what makes something bad is purely opinion. Many would argue that it's a discriminatory thing, possibly even racist (the majority of Muslims aren't white, after all).As for whether Obama is a Muslim, he eats pork, drinks alcohol, and doesn't pray to Mecca multiple times every day. If Obama were a Muslim, he'd be the worst Muslim ever.""Barack Obama's responseI'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.And I think also understanding that Jesus Christ dying for my sins spoke to the humility we all have to have as human beings, that we're sinful and we're flawed and we make mistakes, and that we achieve salvation through the grace of God. But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people and do our best to help them find their own grace.That's what I strive to do. That's what I pray to do every day.

However, I can't find any data on it. Edit: The source on Pre-Obama Real Median Income was wrong. Corrected it.Something else to keep in mind that no one has yet pointed out, they use absolute numbers for some of those stats when what we truly care about are percents.National Debt is typically thought of as a percent of the national GDP, rather than in absolute dollars. For perspective on that, perhaps check out: http://politicsthatwork.com/graphs/debt-gdp-presidentA similar point can be made about debt per citizen. As a counter example, imagine these debt/citizen numbers but that GDP had doubled while Obama was in office while the population had stayed the same. The numbers would be unchanged, but since GDP per capita is double, double the debt would mean no change for any given person.Labor force participation, home ownership rate and real income are all fair stats.Average health insurance rate seems like it could be a little problematic, as they may or may not be taking into account increased subsidies which partially cover the costs of those plans.Food stamp benefits & people in poverty are the same point above with percentages rather than absolute numbers, although I do know the poverty rate rose slightly under Obama.Without actually checking any of their numbers, I can say that the creators of this image have certainly cherry-picked the stats they want to present, especially with regards to absolute numbers presented over percentages.Even if true all implications are false cause fallacies. For example, Labor Participation rate has been steadily declining and can be attributed to many causes like the baby boomers reaching retirement age. Obama increased the debt fixing the mess he inherited.Thank you everyone, your replies were very insightful.another thing I'm wondering about is what measures have improved? no doubt this is a selection of all the things that got ""worse"" (assuming they are accurate and not misleading). would be good to see something with more comprehensive list that isn't trying to push a message."
44,"As far as I know, they had no problem being there on inauguration day, 2009. Obama met with congressional republicans earlier that month to try and work out how to get along with them, so there was no pushback against being at the inauguration.

We are ready to continue our work to confront this economic challenge that is facing our nation and stand ready to work with you to do what is best for America.They seemed on good terms. In 2013, the political climate was quite different. After years of anti-Obama rhetoric working its way through the political system, they may not have all been at the inauguration.

45,"Here's an article that actually covers the issue: https://diplopundit.net/2017/01/06/foreign-service-tradition-political-ambassadors-have-to-be-out-by-january-20/It seems that the 20 Jan deadline is very common occurrence for politically appointed diplomatic positions. They point out that Obama did it, and there's a link to FDR doing it Eisenhower doing the same thing after their elections. Amusingly, the FDR election in question seems to the 1940 election, which was his third victory in a row. In other words, both the article you have linked and the current crop are non-stories.Two quick points: - Obama made [some exceptions to the rule.](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/us/politics/trump-ambassadors.html) (""Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors."")- The ""everybody out"" from Obama came on December 8th. The ""everybody out, no exceptions"" from Trump came on December 23rd. It's only a difference of two weeks, but it probably felt like more. People probably didn't have the the opportunity to get new housing and schooling that started on January (the 23rd was the Friday before the holiday).Edit: some added context.The Bush ambassadors for the G8 and EU left office on:- [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom) : 2/6/2009- [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Russia): 1/2012- [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Canada): 1/20/2009- [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_France): [7/2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Roberts_Stapleton)- [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Germany): 12/5/2008 (no replacement until 9/2009)- [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Italy): 2/6/2009- [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Japan): 1/20/2009- [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_European_Union): 1/18/2009That's the G8 and EU. Out of those 8: - One left before Obama asked- Three left on inauguration day (or thereabouts)- Two left the following month- One stayed until summer- One stayed on for another four yearsIt's definitely not ""everybody out, no exceptions"". The one who stayed until summer was the chair of the Bush-Cheney campaign in CT, so it's not as if Obama was only extending stays for independents or non-partisans, either.Tried to tell my friend about Trump's move to leave political ambassadors hanging on Jan. 20th.

The President has a lot of executive power in the space of immigration. The bigger problem with President Obama's use of executive power is that a successor president can just undo a lot of what Obama did.

47,"There are 28 members of NATO, and Russia is not one of them. NATO was largely the key alliance against Russia in the Cold War and at the end of the Second World War.Lately in the news, a NATO-Russian council meeting has been announced as being held on Monday. These are diplomatic talks; the number of representatives doesn't really mean much as I can find no evidence of majority voting in their procedures. And since the council is largely a diplomatic forum between the 28 member states of NATO collectively and Russia, it's not unlikely that Russia has a few extra delegates to balance things out.Your question is bad and you should feel bad.Russia has zero representatives in NATO."
48,"Before I even look at this, my biggest question is, ""Who cares?!""After reading the article... Well I make it all the way through because it was so overwhelmingly sexist and racist.Human gender, sex and phenotypes are not black and white, they run on a continuum. All women don't look alike and neither do all men. You cannot determine if someone is male or female simply by their appearance. Hell, sometimes you can't even tell someones sex by their DNA - and you absolutely can't tell what their gender is unless you ask them.This ""evidence"" is on par with saying ""Most women are shorter than men. This woman is tall. Therefore 'she' is actually a man."" Nothing here actually constitutes evidence.To just look at the first claim: Both men and women tend to have a shorter index finger than ring finger. But for men, their index finger is, on average 95% as long as their ring finger. In women, their index finger is usually 97% as long as their ring finger. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio). This [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio#/media/File:Digit_ratio_visualization_according_to_data_from_Bailey_and_Hurd,_2005.png) illustrates that you can't make much determination based on it.There are also [lots of pictures of Michelle Obama in high school and growing up](https://www.google.com/search?q=michelle+obama+high+school+pictures&oq=michelle+obama+high+school+pictures&aqs=chrome..69i57.5521j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). So I think this theory can be dismissed pretty easily.This is just part of the weird conspiracy which says that the Obama children are adopted and Barack Obama is gay. Every time the absurdity is pointed out, it's proponents just double-down and make even more ridiculous claims."
49,"It's certainly possible for one hacking group to masquerade as another, but it's also not an easy thing to do. To pull it off, first they would need to know what tools and techniques the Russian groups use which isn't particularly common knowledge and would require a good bit of research. Then they would need to acquire these tools, many of which are likey created by the Russian agencies and not distributed on the dark web (state actors don't like sharing their toys). Then they need to learn how to use these tools proficiently, which is again not particularly easy (you think commercial software is poorly documented, try illegal hacking software from Russia). And finally you need to route your traffic through Russia, which actually is pretty easy.  So it's possible, but not really hacking 101 like the article implies. It's probably difficult enough to pull off that any group that can reliably do it is probably backed by a nation state themselves. The next question you have to ask is who would both want to hack the DNC to hurt Hilary, but would also want to frame Russia, a fact that when it gets out at the very least mitigates the damage to Hilary and probably makes Trump look like he's being backed by Russia. I can't think of any obvious groups that would both have the means to frame Russia and the motive to do so.Are we to presuppose that the CIA made their assessment based on TTPs?"
50,"I'd call that unverifiable.There are a huge number of claims, and each would require psychological, military, and sociological expertise - as well as huge, expensive studies - to analyze. I wouldn't be surprised if the US government has studied this, but if they have they wouldn't make that information public.Given the lack of sources, I'd guess those posters are just making shit up, but that's just my guess.Just evaluate the first statement, ""30% of the American population will actively revolt."".  What is this based on?  Discontent?  Does he ever say what the US government has done to motivate this revolt?    Also, note this posting is before the ""rebels"" took over the U.S. government by the ""political"" process. The guys next post is probably ""oh, never mind"".""The US Goverment has extensively studied..."" What department? Under which administration? When? What was the study called?No citation, no link. Barring something more specific, I tend to take claims of something ""the government"" did as complete bullshit designed to be unverifiable. But I wouldn't even consider this fit for an ""unverifiable"" flair, because its claims are completely unsupported. Unless there are any actual facts being claimed, or specifics about where this claim originates, I'd be inclined to just outright call this **False**.Just commenting because I feel like tearing apart a moron's argument. There is genuine literature on rebellion, insurgency, and counter-insurgency that this person has clearly never read. This is kind of like listening to that one childhood friend of yours breakdown how they could beat up anyone with this series of moves if they do this or that.The OP magically assumes that any civil war will be along partisan lines, but to be honest the political parties right now don't disagree on a single, salient issue large enough for either to want to declare war on the other. The South went to war over slavery, because a huge amount of their economy was perceived to rely on it and that by wanting to free the slaves The North was trying to stifle their industry. What will motivate this population to go to war, a movement against ""political correctness""? The partisan divide is definitely growing, but I doubt it's enough to get 30% of the population on your side to supplant a presumably democratically elected liberal government.The author cites no sources for his section on the population, and I find it difficult to believe that in a country as large and as militaristic as ours, 15% of the population is really the threshold for winning an armed revolution. The American Revolution, at the outset, actHe says that 30% of the population right now would support rebellion, but there's no way of knowing how many would actually mobilize. How many of those are the left-wing people that would apparently support the government? How many of those are just big-talkers who would never get out of their arm-chairs? How many of those have actual military experience? In truth, such a terrorist force would be luck to get around 5%. But supposing you do get 30%, how do you mobilize them? That's 30% *nationally* (I assume). There are lots of right-wing people in Upstate New York, in Washington State, in Oregon, even in California, and that number is probably boosted in these areas. How do you get these anarchist terrorists to coalesce and organize anywhere? And OP fails to recognize that this drains the number of supporters in the states he maintains they would completely take to a sharp minority, meaning they wouldn't even get the state. The author also fails to realize that the rebel side will lose people very swiftly, [as happened in the American Revolution.](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/myths-of-the-american-revolution-10941835/) Fighting for ideals is all well and good for the leadership and the wealthy, but people start deserting once they realize the realities of civil war campaigns: death, injury and infection, food shortages, lack of chicken tendies, etc. In essence, OP is claiming that the government forces would desert in droves, while the entirely unpaid, poorly equipped civilian terrorists with no medical equipment would never lose anyone.And as for the military deserting? OP has a strange definition of Patriot if he thinks they would all abandon the U.S in the event of a civil war. Desertions are rare in the U.S military, and rarely along political lines. Honestly, if the entire army didn't desert during the likes of WWII and Vietnam, you'd have to be a moron to think that even 10% would desert to join a domestic terrorist organization. All these numbers OP brings up are just completely half-assed. Furthermore, the argument that arms manufacturers would support a poor domestic terrorist organization versus the entire market of the United States military because ""traditionalists"" is delusional.As for the plan to target the infrastructure, let's look at a contemporary terrorist movement like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) for a moment; a very motivated terrorist organization in the modern era, that has had its share of supporters in Ireland, yet has routinely failed to win obtain its objectives. The IRA has several advantages this terrorist force does not possess: leadership, actual resources, an actual issue to coalesce on, a focused area to operate in, and an organizational structure. Yet throughout its time, it has failed to achieve any of its objectives in Ireland. Why? Because this shit is a lot harder than just daydreaming about a power grab.Insurgency forces rely on using the population as human shields, according to most Counterinsurgent literature (Martin Van Creveld is an author I recommend on this topic, though few others). First, the assumption that the government forces would not be able to function without an infrastructure while this insurgent guerrilla force would, in addition to not having access to medicine, is simply absurd. The Military has humvees and aircraft, you'd only be crippling yourself. It's unlikely that the government would be so hard-pressed that it couldn't fix the roads *and* pursue you at the same time (I doubt the construction crews they would send for such a task would have been otherwise used to hunt the insurgents down, for instance), and this entire strategy belies a basic misunderstanding of terrorist, insurgent objectives, necessary resources, and actions work and counterinsurgent responses typically go. Insurgent/Terrorist methods rely on disguising themselves in the civilian populace as a means of keeping their members secure (note that OP clearly does not recognize this, and seems to think his terrorist organization can win in open warfare against guys with tanks; I don't care how much of the army deserts, *they are not bringing tanks with them*). To do that, insurgents have to endear themselves to the populace and incentivize keeping the safe: something that, by targeting powerplants, roads, bridges, airports, they simply don't accomplish. By attacking the infrastructure civilians benefit from, these domestic terrorists would, conversely, prove the necessity of the government to supply power and roads for the population and prove that it must keep them safe from domestic terrorists. Ergo, this alt-right army loses popular support and their human shields, meaning they can be targeted precisely within the population that doesn't attempt to hide them.The key question is, where are you hiding these forces? The woods? If the government treated you halfway seriously, they burn down the woods, and if they don't they just quarantine you until you run out of food. Meld with the population? You just blew up several power plants, their food is all spoiling, their schools are closed, and they can't work. Someone rats you out. Even if by some miracle people do support you, the assumption is that the entire United States intelligence community cannot determine where you are between phone taps, satellite imaging, and everything. OP claims that the United States would be forced to take extreme and harsh measures, but this also isn't true. Extreme destructive measures according to counterinsurgent strategy are only necessary when you do not have an incredible intelligence advantage, which the government has as none of the population wants to help the guys targeting sewage treatment plants and power plants, or the people on your side. I just can't see how this gets the response OP is stating they would Hell, they'd be lucky if the government mobilizes the FBI for this shit, much less the United States army. Overall, I'd say this post is complete bullshit. It cites no sources, and assumes almost no action by the government. Honestly, if overthrowing the government were ever this simple it would have been done before. OP talks about getting 30% of the population, which is completely bullshit, but talks as though he has 50% or 60%. He thinks he'd get almost all of the military to commit treason on their country when this didn't happen in the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, or Vietnam, and that the entirety of Texas would leave when they receive the most federal money by far of any state and that the rest of the nation would honestly give a shit.I think its funny they assume red states are 100% republican and therefore means they control it all.Texas is 44% not conservative for example.  Most of the hard working hispanic friends are not red and would not sit by and let bubba fuck over his family and nor would many of the liberals they talk about.They also assume, wrongly that liberals (esp in Texas) do not own guns/have survival training/former military/shoot at the gun range.Except we do all those things and on top of that, we have solar panels to keep the power flowing and they dont.They also assume those IEDs they are talking about putting on roads only kill 'big guberment' people.  Well news flash, the liberals will be driving those roads. You kill innocent civilians, you lose the PR battle instantly.  You arent a rebel faction, are a terrorist group and that is all  you will be called by everyone on media.Fucking over civilians by taking out bridges and power, wont make the population aka other 70% side with you, or 'sit by and watch' and in fact 99% chance a large part of that group rises up to counter your stupid bullshit because you are fucking with their lives.  We ignore your bullshit because we are distracted.  Give us a fucking reason to openly oppose you and guns or not, logistically, this rebellion cant do shit against the people being in their way. Oh look, a rebel group took over Ft. Hood.  A million people, civilians are camped outside it on every direction and now you cant move.  What's the plan for that? Choose carefully.What are you gonna do when 10,000 people are protesting where you wanna attack the government? Kill them? Sacrifice them for your cause? You just lost the PR campaign.We dont have to like the government or support the government to be against people that dont care if 10,000 people year starve to death in a rebellion.Unlike the educated blue, the idiot rednecks would wave banners showing who they support (confederate flags etc) and make themselves pretty easy targets for those us that would oppose them.See I too can talk like that.

52,"The article says he didn't die from the maggots. For the most part fly larvae only feed on dead tissue. An exception is the screworm fly which was eradicated in the mainland US.No. If you read the article, it is very clear that the patient died of sepsis. It also is stated that the patient's son begged for the patient's pain medication to be increased so he could have his dressings changed. It may be that case that the patient would not tolerate his dressings being changed without more pain medication, but his doctors felt an increase in pain medication would kill him. It's sad, but sometimes an elderly patient arrives at a hospital in a state where all the staff can do is make them as comfortable as possible. A 72 year old who arrives with old dressings, enough deal tissue to have maggots in the wound and is in sepsis doesn't have a great chance of leaving the hospital.Whatever the circumstances I am convinced things like this would not happen in a comparable western European (veteran's) hospital. The US is becoming a failed society and all this feels perfectly similar to what was happening to the USSR in the late 80s."
53,"Facts still matter to me, if that means anything.America has always had a strain of anti intellectualism but it really has been coming to a boiling point over the last few decades.  Two books stuck out at me over this past year as being particularly prescient:  [The Age of American Unreason](https://smile.amazon.com/Age-American-Unreason-Susan-Jacoby/dp/1400096383?sa-no-redirect=1) by Susan Jacoby, and [Just How Stupid Are We?](https://smile.amazon.com/Just-How-Stupid-Are-We/dp/0465014933?sa-no-redirect=1) by Rick Shenkman.Both of them diagnosed a problem that is inherent to all people but pronounced in Americans.  We are easily manipulated and rarely bother researching our positions.  We attack experts who disagree with us as elitist, [as though that was a bad thing](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ge4f8a/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-headlines---gaffe-in) (relevant rant starts at 7:15).  This isn't some isolated thing that only exists in the talking head boxes on cable news.  [The Texas GOP openly opposed critical thinking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/texas-gop-rejects-critical-thinking-skills-really/2012/07/08/gJQAHNpFXW_blog.html).  The only way we get past this is to push back against the anti-intellectualism, and we do that by trying to get people to reflect on their own decision making.  [There are ways of engaging the critical thinking skills of others without directly calling them out on bullshit and starting fights](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4116).Most have a general bias one way.  I acknowledge my right leaning, because I associate liberals as the hippies of the 70's that spit in my father's face when he got back from Vietnam.  I'm pro 2nd amendment, pro choice, pro gay marriage, pro Nationalized Health Care.  I voted Bush, Perot, Bush, Libertarian (forgot the name), Paul, Obama, Trump.I personally believe we all have a natural tendency, based on a preselected leaning, to excuse or dismiss negatives of the candidate on the favored side, and be severely judgmental for the candidate on the opposing side.  A female that's been somewhat forced to be a part of my life has gone off for decades how about the ""war on whites,"" was SHOCKED at Trump's xenophobic statements.  She's always going on about how petty and stupid women are in the work place, and how they can't be trusted not to cat fight when left to their own proclivities, but was just aghast at Trump's misogyny.  She's far from the only example.One thing that could be worth trying is a joint fact checking project by two respected groups on either side of the political divide.  The AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies could be a precedent for such an effort.  Probably selecting which claims to jointly fact check would be the most difficult thing.The point is that you need the best information available to make cogent decisions. Regardless of whether or not others make good political decisions, you still need to make your own decisions. The only thing that will prevent tyranny is vigilance, and contrary to what people believe it will likely affect you.I think this has been the case for some time, ever since this country rejected intellect (Gore) over the guy who they'd want to have a drink with (Bush). Couple that with the growing anti-science movement in this country and you get where we are today.[removed]"

56,"Tis' a noble cause, and we're more in the need of it now than ever. I think what you'd need to do is devise something punchy an memorable. Maybe devise a fact-checking cheat-sheet summary. Just reduce it to three words, each addressing an underlying logical fallacy that's widespread on the internet?Are you aware/what do you think of this http:://www.propornot.comAwesome idea, I'd love to see what you come up withThank you so much for posting this. The dissemination of false information, I believe, is one of the most frightening aspects of our modern era. How can we have a functioning democracy if they people are operating on false or misleading information?I think you've made several good points here and the introduction of some sort of verification system for reported information could go a long way in keeping misinformation in check.I think you may have missed a very integral part of the problem.  For every falsehood there already exists the actual facts they are misrepresenting.  Without some heavy handed 1st amendment violations you are never going to remove those misrepresentations.  So the problem to face is how to inject information which is factual true but emotionally 'false' into individual reality bubbles.  It's one thing to educate people who are interested in learning the concept or even learning in general.  But to accomplish the larger part of this task you would need to both adhere rigidly to factual basis on a wide variety of topics and find a way to express that information to people that don't want to hear it."
57,"The reality is we are in an age of post-politics where the aim is not just to manipulate people, but to got deeper and play with and undermine their perception of the world, so they are never sure what is really happening.Putin turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theatre. He used Kremlin money to sponsor all kinds of groups. From mass, anti-fascist youth organizations to the very opposite; neo-nazi skinheads. And liberal human rights groups who then attacked the government. Putin even backed whole political parties that were opposed to President Putin.But the KEY THING was, Putin then let it be known that this is what he was doing. Which meant that no one knew what was real or what was fake in modern Russia.This is the same as how Donald Trump's campaign was run. ""Many of the facts that Trump asserted were also completely untrue, but Trump didn't care...he and his audience knew knew that much of what he said bore little relationship to reality. This meant that Trump defeated journalism because the journalist's central belief was that their job was to expose lies and assert the truth. With Trump, this became irrelevant.""We are seeing the same thing in the Democratic Party.  Hillary employed these subversive tactics.  News about Bernie has been all over the map post-election.  It's hard for everyone but post-politics aren't going to ever disappear so we need to get really good at separating propaganda from real news.If this subject intrigues you, I highly recommend [Hypernormalization](https://thoughtmaybe.com/hypernormalisation/?lang=en).  It's a new BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, it's 2h45m and it's kind of dry but extremely informative.  His conclusions are his opinions however.

Sure, we'd like to suppress fake news, and lots of people want to suppress news we don't want people to know about.Bill Clinton didn't want anyone to know about his Phoenix airplane meeting with Loretta Lynch.  We were fortunate that a local Phoenix news crew was there and got us the news.Hillary Clinton didn't want anyone to know how ill she's been on the campaign trail.President Obama didn't want anyone to know what actually happened in the White House hours and days after the attack on Benghazi.Any attempt to censor fake news will slip into censoring news we don't want people to know about."
58,"Well, this is a scientific question. How do scientists overcome bias in their research when collecting data? One important method is increasing sample size. So consume news from more media. Abother other important method is consider the scope of your sampling. Choose media with different biases: liberal and conservative, national and international. Finally, prune outliers that obfuscate potentially real trends. Avoid media that are known to make consistently false claims or claims impossible to verify independently.the same way you knew what to believe before: you don't. the concept of ""post-fact"" is, itself, memetic propaganda. propaganda has existed since the beginning of recorded history, and public gullibility hasn't changed since then, either. the big difference between modern information warfare and classic information warfare is that modern reaches its audience much more quickly. it's also much more readily available, and the ""telephone"" effect of it being spread is more easily achieved.the initial ""smell test"" that i have for media is whether or not it respects the burden of proof. a big example being recent sexual impropriety allegations against trump. the many articles that lambasted trump didn't bother to even acknowledge the burden of proof, and pushed anecdotal accounts as truth, while providing professionally edited & designed graphics and video media that used emotionally compelling audio and visual aspects to reinforce the legitimacy of the claims. many articles even called these women ""victims"" and used other professional rhetorical devices to ""lead"" readers into assuming that the claims had merit. none that i read even acknowledged the burden of proof.what i suggest, for anybody who wants to learn to think and read critically, is to look into the fundamental aspects of western philosophy. a basic understanding of rhetoric, argumentation, and logic will go a long way to helping understand the intent and motivations of various media.If the statement's truthfulness cant be discerned on its own I use a balance of probability approach. * more claimant more believable than less claimant: if 10  guys told me climate change is real but 5 guys told me its false. i will probably think its real  * Expert claimant is more believable than amateur claimant: 10 accountants told me that climate change is real, but 5 climate scientist told me its fake. i will probably think its fake.* impartial claimant is more believable than partial claimant: 10 accountants told me that climate change is real, but 5 climate scientist from Exxonmobil told me its fake. i would think its a hard call and look for more people to tell me what's what* Reputable claimant is more believable than claimants a with history of lies: 10 accountants and 5 Nobel prize winners told me that climate change is real, but 5 climate scientist from Exxonmobil and 10 politician told me its fake. i would think its probably realJim asks a very pertinent question. I’m a sustainability researcher working on the complete sustainability problem using root cause analysis and simulation modeling. The main line of research was performed from 2003 to 2010, with one peer reviewed paper published in 2010.Let me try to summarize. There’s a reason we’re seeing more and more “news” that may or may not be true, as well as political statements. Deception, aka propaganda and lies, is the winning strategy if people’s truth literacy is low. That Trump won demonstrates that in the US, truth literacy is tragically low. I base this claim on data, not partisanship. For example, the Washington Post’s [2016 Election Fact Checker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/fact-checker/) showed that Trump’s main strategy was blatant lies, while Clinton’s was much closer to the truth. I’ve explained why this appears to be so and what can be done about it in a recent article on [The Power of Deception Just Won](http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/023_DeceptionWon/index.htm). **“How do we know what to believe?”** – If we were able to resolve the root cause of why Trump won, our political world would change drastically. Currently it’s stuck in a race to the bottom, where politicians compete to see who can tell the most appealing lies. But once the root cause is resolved and truth literacy goes from low to high, the system flips into a dominant race to the top, where politicians compete on the basis of the truth. Here “truth” means roughly what optimizes the common good of all.**“But there must be a solution to it.”** – It appears there is. The above article briefly summarizes three sample solutions for resolving the root cause. One, Politician Truth Ratings, is already partially implemented since it’s based on fact checking. Thanks Jim. Good questions.Learn something about the media, and about the topics that they cover. You will start to see which parts are emphasizing unimportant or fallacious things. You will also start to see that some things take time to develop, and get a feel for when media outlets rush to judgement. The Trump transition is a perfect example of the latter. We don't even know the full line-up of his advisors, so you can't really say much about how it's going. Some articles want to use it as a launching point to attack Trump, which is something else you have to watch for. The only solution is to get more information, and learn how to analyze it. Get smarter.Was there some ""fact-present"" era of politics I somehow missed out on?>how do we know what to believe?This is the age old question everyone comes to once they realize they live in a world where their opinions are fed to them daily. What to wear, eat, say, think, buy - all these and more are daily fed to you through your own self selected paradigm. Actually thinking about things (what they mean, researching who said what, who stands to gain and what the implications are to your existing world view) is hard. It takes a lot of time to do fully, time most people just don't have. Its easy to just believe what the ""experts"" on TV or online are telling you than to do your own research on the subject, educate yourself and form your own opinion. You also need to be extremely careful about what sources you read (for example, believing something you read on some random blog vs believing what you read in a peer reviewed study or from a source that is reputable).Personally, I tend to treat most opinion things I read as inherently self serving. I take the facts from a news article (this thing happened in this place at this time) and leave the opinion stuff in the trash. Some of the speculation and questions are good because it can spark avenues for initial avenues for exploration, but it doesn't form my judgement. I go to other sources on the same subject to see if they can fill in factual gaps or if they have a different angle of insight. Once I'm done gathering information I look at it (and the sources), assign weights based on likelihood of truthfulness and then make an assessment on what the information means and assign a probability to my assessment based on the body of evidence.  Even after all that processing, I'm still only right about 70% of the time either due to missing information which changes the underlying understanding of the situation, or something random happening.Good luck"
59,"There were lots of people purged from voter rolls. Some were probably valid voters that got taken off. Others were not. Yes, there were lots of voters purged, perhaps more than the margin of victory, but it's very unlikely it would have affected the outcome. If the people tried to vote in large enough numbers to affect the outcome, we would have heard about large numbers of complaints. Instead, we notice that most people don't vote.The 2013 Supreme Court Decision in Holder v. Shelby County definitely made it harder for some typical democrat types to vote in many states that went red, but the final data hasn't been collected. The Brennan Center for Justie at NYU Law has some helpful research. https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-problems-present-2016-further-study-needed-determine-impactIt certainly didn't help Clinton. But in the final analysis, Hillary lost the Obama voters, like this quote from Michael Moore about Michigan voters:>90,000 [Democrat] Michiganders voted for every office and every ballot proposal on both sides of the ballot — and refused to vote for president. They were not going to vote for Trump … but they had refused to participate in a system that had left them forgotten.”I will admit, I'm biased.

61,"I have seen it just yesterday, during the elections, but I can't remember where. And yesterday, while I was watching it, I remembered I saw it already about a year ago. Now I came searching for it this afternoon, because I wanted to see it again, and found that thread and the allegations it was a meme. In the first place, how am I supposed to search for a meme without ever hearing about it? And second, it was a video and not a picture and it definitely wasn't People magazine, so I am sure the thing I am searching for does exist. I'm totally mindfucked.I've been trying to find this video for hours now, saw it last night on facebook but I didnt realize it was scrubbed from the internet until I saw a meme claiming it was false this morning. I've seen it multiple times this past year but siddenly its the hardest thing to find. Honestly I think the memes that say it's from people magazine were set up to ensure the claim would be untrue. I remember it being from an Oprah interview every time I saw it. Time to get my old tinfoil hat out.I KNOW that I saw this video.It's not the Oprah 1988 video. in my mind the interview was conducted outdoors, somewhere that looked a bit like a skate park..Something random like that.THIS IS NOT A MEME.  I just saw this audio/video clip of an old interview with Trump saying exactly that ""I’d run as Republican. They are the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe everything on Fox News."" JUST in the past 3 days (I think it was during a discussion on CNN and they referenced it). It was a couple of decades old. I'm sure that the government had it removed as soon as they realized he was going to win to keep Republicans from getting more angry than they already are. And it is NOT A VOICEOVER. It is him, moving his mouth, in his accent, being interviewed for several minutes.i never saw the video personally but i remember reading about the quote from something that wasn't a meme.  eerie that it was just taken down."
62,"I will say that it definitely seems that, even if all the information presented is accurate (and I'm not certain it is), the questions themselves are biased, worded specifically to favor (in almost all cases) what would generally be considered the more ""conservative"" answer. In addition, I see at least some evidence that the studies this page refers to are cherry-picked.For example, you may notice that question #1 specifically references only 4th graders. Why that specific grade level? Well, they say so themselves: ""Confusion about this may stem from the fact that the relative performance of U.S. students declines over time, and by the age of 15, they drop to 50% in reading and to the bottom 25% in math."", and in fact [studies of 15 year-olds show average to below average test results](https://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/PISA-2012-results-US.pdf). Again, this doesn't make the question and answer of the page OP linked to *wrong*, so much as slanted.As another example, question #4 deals with private and charter schools, which are supported more by the right than the left, and asks if they cause an academic decline. Again, this is a misleading question, because the left's frustrations with these schools isn't academic performance, but lack of transparency and accountability. But if you take this question to voters who have a simple conception of ""this is good"" or ""this is bad"", then the ""this is good"" folks will of course be correct more often simply because the question was designed to cater to them.Another indication of a bias at work here: in the answer to question #7, it states, ""In 2015, federal, state and local governments spent a combined total of $6.1 trillion or an average of $49,000 for every household in the U.S. **For reference, the average U.S. household spends about $41,000 per year on food, housing, clothing, transportation, and healthcare.**""Why is that ""for reference"" thing even mentioned here, except to push an agenda?I will of course let others here chime in, but as it stands I'm heavily in favor of marking this as **Partisan Bias** because of its clearly slanted questions, as well as the way the information is being presented is clearly done with a partisan bent."
63,"Just to be clear, evidence of a sign outside his house is not evidence that he put it there. It would take a truly massive deficit of intelligence or political savvy for someone like Comey, with the position he has and the attention he has gotten from the media already, to do something so blatantly partisan, even if he supports Trump.I know absolutely nothing about Comey, but I find it more likely that someone else put it there, maybe even the photographer, as a political statement.As pointed out via the link in the article, Comey put this house up for sale in 2015.This is no longer his residence.Does that answer your question?http://www.snopes.com/fbi-director-james-comeys-trump-sign/"
64,"Yes, you can either get the deduction paid for directly or be reimbursed at the end of the year.  So if you qualify for a $200 deduction you can get a plan with a $300 premium and pay $100 a month for it or you can pay the $300 a month out of pocket and at the end of the year get a check for $2,400 (you can apply any amount of your credit to your plan).  When you see people do these comparisons they tend to either ignore the tax credit or choose some of the awful plans (there are some truly horrendously priced plans on some exchanges).  The plans change by state, and the way the plans are labeled is a bit strange.  Most people assume that Bronze or catastrophic plans will be the cheapest but Silver plans are eligible for special discounts that allow some people to have very good plans for much cheaper than what would normally be found.Just given the source (the_donald), I would not believe it without supporting evidence.Regardless, going to healthcae.gov and looking at a Silver Plan with Medium Usage and needing insulin in/around my hometown/state, and $20K income, no health insurance from work, 24 years old, smoker, female:     healthcare.gov shows me a seemingly decent plan of:$107.90/month     $0 deductible     $2K max out-of-pocket     $100 ER     $5 generic drugs$2 primary doc     $15 specialist docYeah, just looking at that ... the_donald is full of shit.I assume other states would be different and larger cities would be more expensive, etc. But still. It smells like bullshit.It also depends on what state you live in. For instance I do not live in a participating state. My monthly out of pocket expense is 538 per month with a 6400 yearly deductible and I am only fully insured in a specific participating care network and only in-state. The insurance I have (Aetna) is pulling out of the exchange and my insurance plan is being canceled as of Janurary 1 2017.[deleted]"
65,"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/They are using [270towin](http://www.270towin.com/) to create maps, but the women and men thing is true, but also not very surprising (in general women support democrats and men support repblicans, but the correlation is usually weaker and drowned out by other factors).  It should also be noted that the data used in the 538 post is potentially older than the second debate so it may not still be accurate.  538 has several very good articles on voting demographics this election.The other maps they made would just require finding the data.And yes, skepticism of that subreddit is absolutely warranted.I clicked on that link and saw some of the most racist comments I've read in a good long time. I thought people like that only existed in bad fiction./edit: a wordechoing the other posters, yes the maps and data for men/women are true and from 538... the remaining maps are suspect but only because the data is missing, looks like they just created a pile of maps from 270towin but the only ones I've seen published are the men/women. An interesting tell at the bottom of the map is the asterisk explaining why they didn't break out different groups from People of Color, and likely yes, if only POC voted then the electoral college would be 100 Dem, but that does not equal 100% Dem votes, it just means >=51% voted a particular way delivering the electoral votes... The same can be applied to all the other maps.  Neat to look at, generally meaningless, unless you're a pollster for a campaign."

As of right now it is accusations without anything much more substantial, we should learn more in December when the trial begins to actually ramp up.Trump is friends with convicted pervert pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has taken a ride on the airplane the Lolita Express and has dined with Jeffrey, and Trump vouched support for the pedophile in the New York magazine saying, """"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

68,"Michael Froman was on the Obama transition team. It was never a secret. Here is the transition team's webpage, with his name on it:http://change.gov/learn/transitionstaffOne of the primary functions of the transition team is to help the new president pick his cabinet. The members of the team would be emailing names back and forth, and handing out vetting assignments. Podesta, Obama, and a few others would discuss the names on the list and narrow it over a period of weeks. So every person eventually selected for the cabinet would appear on those lists. And as the process went on, the lists would get narrower and narrower until they looked very much like the cabinet that would eventually be selected.So here's your big scandal: president's transition team helps president select cabinet.I expect this kind of idiocy from Wikileaks and Russia Today. And I knew that the standards at the New Republic had fallen, but goddamn, this is just embarrassing.Just a note for OP regarding rt.com. It's been rebranded, but RT is the media outlet formerly known as Pravda. The broadsheet still exists, but it was spun out of government control under Yeltsin.> The same banks that were bailed out apparently also had a major hand in appointing Obama's cabinet.This is your first mistake. Banks don't appoint Presidential cabinet members.> Do you have any reason to believe that this story is fabricated/exaggerated?Yes. Reason dictates that there is no conceivable reason President Obama would have felt pressured to do this, let alone carried through.I mean, think about it: Why would ONE very specific bank CEO have this much influence?Don't you think Goldman Sachs would have had more of a say?You realize, also, that there are a multitude of competing interests vying for the attention of the President of the United States, yes? This reason alone, perhaps, is why there isn't as much corruption as there might otherwise be. If those competing interests caught wind of it, or sensed favoritism, you better bet they'd be making a lot of noise.Finally, your source: RT.com. It's a Russian propaganda outlet. Any news story on that site related to American or Russian interests is usually full of outright B.S.RT is Russian propaganda so I wouldn't trust anything from there.  The Wikileaks documents have in general been blown out of proportion to what they actually say.  Even if it were true that Obama took the recommendation for cabinet officers from an executive what exactly does that show?  Can you list a reason why any members of his cabinet are corrupt or inept?  Seems like they were all [qualified and well suited for the jobs they had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Obama_Administration_cabinet_members).Being that Bush had just signed TARP legislation, Obama would have bankers  since he would be looking for experienced people to help successfully carry it out"

The FBI agents we can verify, like Jason Herring [in this hearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUiU8c9fw0c), seem to support Comey's decision."
70,"Two problems with this question:1. This isn't asking about anyone in particular, but numerous people.2. It's difficult to rate how ""truthful"" any person is, at least objectively, because the claims that you use to determine this are almost certainly subject to cherry-picking, whether you intend to or not.Stick to asking about individual claims made by someone. That, at least, can usually be pinned down to something factual, or not.It's always been my belief that it is not possible to be totally rational, because humans have biases and agendas. Instead, it's better to just let other people represent their version of the argument. That's why I don't really care for people like John Oliver or Paul Joseph Watson, because I think it's entertaining but quite intellectually dishonest, as you will do your best to present your opponent in the worst light possible. I like watching John Oliver, as I consider myself liberal, but I watch it with a grain of salt.If you look into Paul Joseph Watson, the 'facts' he presents are pretty easily discredited with a simple Google search. He is one of the most intellectually dishonest, know-nothing commentators among the entire conservative Youtube community. I was trying to pick one example but most of his videos are nonsensical strawmen.Anyways, tl;dr - Political commentators are inherently full of shit, it's better to watch panel shows or debates where they both have an appropriate platform to get their views across.I cannot speak to those channels but there are many research oriented alt news/editorial channels both progressive and conservative that I enjoy including: The Jimmy Dore Show, Lionel Nation, Progressive News with Tim Black, The Sane Progressive, The New Progressive Voice, Michael Trimm, The Humanist Report, Secular Talk, and many more. I have all these channels fed into a sub I mod called /r/politicalvideos.I usually base the merit of channels like that on their subscriber numbers, whether they cite their sources well, the types of commenters and community they foster for themselves.I find that there usually is a pretty obvious difference to a guy like HA Goodman or Michael Trimm, who reads you their research and offers their opinions, and a guy like Alex Jones who cites rumors and allegations/speculations found in blog posts then abstracts those to fit a conspiratorial narrative, basically fantasy from one end to the other. Which is fine for entertainment, but not for education.They are all internet talk radio. Take everything with a grain of salt.Not very credible. The question is far too broad to give definitive examples - but broadly speaking these people are self-taught rather than formally instructed (while I'm not claiming that only people that have been to University are credible sources for political and social commentary - quick google searches and education through other YouTube videos etc. are not a legitimate alternative for research and instruction) and far, far too simplistic in their analysis.I often forget it myself as someone whom occasionally goes through phases of watching videos from a few of the people you cited and others from that general 'circle', but the demographic on YouTube is EXTREMELY young and the 'market' they are putting themselves out to is not exactly a highly-educated group of patient and well-informed individuals. As such YouTubers that comment on these matters referenced, are incentivised (if they want to be successful) to streamline the issues they discuss into simpler and simpler bitesizes, that usually take a clear ideological bent one way or the other as the market does little for those who cater to the grey area, nuance and uncertainty of most big complicated issues in reality.In regards to their (imo cringey) claims to being amongst other things 'sceptics, rational-thinkers, users of logic' etc. this is I think just a consequence of identity politics. Much of the community that you refer to grew out of what was originally a largely 'atheist' community on YouTube that responded to mainly creationists and christians. As such many people embraced the identity politics of the 'rational' and 'scientific' side of the argument because they defended things like evolution, even though they themselves may never have had any formal training in science etc. Since then the name tags have just stuck... Edit - As the 'new media' has grown and 'old/ mainstream media' is increasingly discredited amongst circles such as these thinkers this has been another reason to self-identify as 'rational' and 'independent' which might also explain the name tags persistence..One final issue I would raise with them - They live and think (like a lot of people of a certain demographic increasingly do) in what I call an 'internet bubble', whereby all of their information and interaction comes through the internet. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this but it does give them a fairly myopic perspective on things. For example an 'SJW' outrage viral video will do the rounds when it comes out through most of these channels and will be treated like it's the most important thing in discussion for that day/ week when in reality the vast majority of people (especially people that vote in elections when these channels switch to political commentary) are not as invested in the internet and 'internet culture' as they are. As such they will often make generalisations about say the 2016 Presidential elections based on their internet experience. For example - 'Clinton lost because 'SJW's' went too far' is a common analysis I've started hearing from these kinds of channels. I don't have any data to back up what I'm counteracting with but if you interviewed most actual voters in the important swing states I don't think many of them would report that their main reasons for voting were to do with a few of the 'SJW' videos that went viral that year! I doubt they even know of the existence of such things!!TLDR - no take what they say with a pinch of salt!Personally, I think you're assumptions about their values and intent are slightly off.  I think the educational and ""video essay"" channels like nerdwriter and sargon, are more about promoting intellectual thought and a new framework for appreciating a particular subject-than being 100% truthful.  None of them claim to be an authority on a particular subject and none of them claim what they're saying is an inarguable truth.  They talk about things they find interesting and hope it resonates with others.  Its one thing to blatantly lie about something like cellular biology, but when it comes to the subjects they discuss (which are mostly art and culture), truth is kind of subjective.  Thats sorta the point."

72,"I think the most important thing you may not know is that DLA Piper is a giant legal firm. You may have already figured out that the Lockheed Martin claim is unsupported, because *of course* Lockheed is going to get gov't contracts--that's exactly what they exist to do, and there are so few companies in that space. The same applies to DLA Piper given their size and type of work they do. If it's an indictment of anything, it's an indictment of corporate consolidation. When there are 10 huge companies doing what 100 companies used to do, there will be 10 times the coincidental overlap that you see here. And it's a pretty distant overlap, that James Comey's brother works in real estate for DLA while another branch audited the foundation, therefore...what?Also the article is very selective with what facts they share. You can look up DLA and many other companies on opensecrets.org to see what kind of contributions their employees make. They like Hillary. They also like Obama. And John Kerry. Mitt Romney did pretty well because he's a finance guy too, but mostly these are big city college grads who want liberals to win elections. That's not a conspiracy because it's not a secret.The article is from a website that is also questioning if Clinton is using a body double and has a ""Hillary or Hitler"" quiz (though, as they will tell you they are 'non-partisan').  The source is utter rubbish by any standard you want to use.  They also cite absolutely no credible sources of their own, and a search of credible sources turns up nothing.  The article is a hit piece written by partisans who have no interest in the truth, but rather trying to revive a dead controversy.  Proving this article wrong would be the same as proving that unicorns don't exist, impossible but also unnecessary.James Comey's brother, Peter Comey, is the Senior Director of real-estate operations at DLA Piper. DLA Piper did an audit of the Clinton foundation's taxes that found a lot of undisclosed donations:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-foundation-tax-forms-reveal-millions-in-unreported-donations/article/2576527I'm pretty sure Peter wasn't involved in that though, since he was in real-estate."

76,"I work for an insurance company, and honestly these numbers aren't that out of the ordinary, although they must live in a state that is extra expensive, for a plan that poor where I am the premium for a family would be about half that. Either way, the ACA (obamacare) did a lot of things right, but it absolutely isn't a perfect system and people on the left really aren't always crazy about it either. One of the major criticisms is that it works extremely well for those that are very low income, but above the Medicaid threshold, has no major impact on those getting insurance from a large business owner, and hurts those middle income and small business owners. Honestly a smart move for these employers would be to move to a defined contribution structure, where instead of buying insurance for employees, you provide a fixed dollar amount to put towards premiums bought on the marketplace. That would help alleviate the exorbitant premiums you're seeing in this example, as well as help keep costs controlled as you control the amount that any given employer is spending on these costs. That all said, it still wouldn't help a family if their employers don't want to provide anything to help, although it might be safe to assume in those situations, a person would be eligible for some tax credits or rebates. All that is a long way to say that the context here is pretty accurate and that people do have some fairly legitimate complaints about the system, but that what this doesn't show is the other side of all the uninsured who now have coverage and won't be bankrupted by even a minor illnesswell without more info, its misleading whichever way you choose to look at it.  The top plan is similar to [this](https://www.uhc.com/content/dam/uhcdotcom/en/iex/tx/Bronze-Compass-Balanced-6500.pdf) pdf which is the current plan (names might differ by state and year this was done)  I'm not sure its recent or what state since its just a pic of a screen. Short version, yeah the post is likely legit but without more facts it just as well might be a fact in a vacuum... no context no factcheckingNot to rehash the whole ACA/Obamacare GOP vs Dems headache but the way the law works it only allows 4 major groups as seen [here](https://www.uhc.com/individual-and-family/health-insurance-marketplace/how-to-choose-a-health-insurance-plan/insurance-plan-categories) to avoid a [tyranny of choice](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/Sci.Amer.pdf) problem for those not well informed about healthcare options.Based on the ""OH"" in the middle of the plan names, I'm guessing they're shopping in Ohio. Based off her LinkedIn, she's in the Columbus area, so I'll use zip code 43201. It sounds like she has grown kids and someone else in the house (I'll call husband), so let's put 65 and 60 years old. And they both smoke because why not. I put the household income at $100k so they wouldn't get any subsidies.If I use the [calculator](https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/#/plan/results) on healthcare.gov, I come up with $1182 (~$200 less) for the cheaper option and $1217 for the Aetna plan. (Note: you knock ~$150 off if you aren't a tobacco user.)So, it's in the right ballpark, especially since we don't have all the pertinent details to exactly recreate the options. On the other hand, I am thoroughly and completely skeptical on that Aetna plan for two older individuals ever coming to $258 a month. Based on personal experience shopping pre-Obamacare, that sounds like a good price for a high deductible 80/20 plan with no out-of-pocket maximum. Summary - Unverifiable in general without more details. Plausible for the screenshot prices, but skepticism warranted on older plans.What state is this in?How many insurance providers did the poster look into before deciding  what the ""best"" plan is?What is included on both plans?At what dates were these taken? What's this person's income level? There's so much information missing here that it can't be anything *but* misleading,  or at least hardly indicative.One thing to note is that plans vary dramatically by state. I'm paying $1,185/mo for a gold plan for me, my wife, and four kids. There is a $2,500 deductible and no deductible for office visits."

I agree, she did get her own money back, but how much?  All of it, some of it.  More than she put in with regard to a reasonable return.  SS & Medicare exist for people who have circumstances (As Ayn Rand's medical expenses) for which they cannot afford.  Due largely impart to no fault of their own but more so of the Greedy Healthcare System....I like Ayn Rand but I do believe the language she used was divisive and seemed to feed her own need to be a radical."
79,"On your second point, note that states get first dibs on taxing income and that state income tax is deductible from your Federal taxable income.  Also, Florida doesn't have a state personal income tax, you're thinking of the 6% FL state sales tax.Since you're going with Moody's analysis you should also note that your source says 2.4% average annual inflation over the next decade in the Clinton case and 3.0% in the Trump case.  In 2026 those Clinton economy dollars are worth 6.0% more than those 2026 Trump economy dollars.  Should also be noted that while 5.7% is the average, Moody's are nice enough to give year-by-year S&P index forecasts so it's possible to be more precise about the value of the investment at the end of the decade (Trump makes S&P index funds nice and cheap in the first five years before doing most of their 10-year growing when half the investment is already made, so it might not be quite as bad a difference as the 5.7% vs 4.0% averages indicate at first glance).Awesome,  thanks for this.r/titlegore"
80,"It's only 247 seats in the house according to [The Office of the Clerk of the US House of Representatives.](http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/cong.aspx) Honestly I didn't look up the legislative chambers but the Governors and Senate numbers are correct. Supreme Court appointments are always a little fuzzy. While most justices tend to fall along the ideologies of the Presidents who seek their appointment, when the Senate is controlled by a different political party as the President you tend to get more moderate candidates. Even when the President and Senate are of the same party, a rabid ideolog like Justice Scalia is the exception rather than the rule. Also, sometimes the Justices behave much differently than is expected once they are appointed to the Supreme Court. For example Justice Anthony Kennedy was appointed by Ronald Regan, yet is considered to be a moderate justice who reviews cases on their legal basis rather than through the lens of a particular ideology.I found [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_legislatures) list helpful to illuminate the state legislative numbers. As of July 2016 (assuming the list is correct) the split is 69-30 in the state houses (Nebraska is not bi-cameral, house/senate but just 1 body) The list also highlights how OPs' presentation of the data while factually correct skews the fact that several of those GOP chambers have to go through DEM Govenors (just like the federal level) and a few vice versa.  This breakdown from that page is less skewed by showing GOP control in context:23	Republican-controlled governments7	Democratic-controlled governments7	Democratic governor/Republican-controlled legislature4	Republican governor/Democratic-controlled legislature1	Independent governor/Republican-controlled legislature4	Republican governor/Split legislature4	Democratic governor/Split legislature50	Total(edit formatting)"
81,"You can say that the US was founded, in part, on ideals like individualism and self reliance, but obviously it didn't have much to do with ""getting off the dole"", or with ""faith"".The Founders were primarily influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment, and did not invoke God in the Constitution. In fact, the only reference to religion in the Constitution comes in the First Amendment, which explicitly forbids congress to either establish a state religion, or to limit religious expression.William Bradford did experiment briefly with a communal agricultural system before deciding instead to distribute the colony's land to its male members, but it's not clear that this was due to a failure of the communal system rather than a response to popular demand. At any rate, it's important to note that [Bradford distributed the land to *all* members of the colony](http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford), and not just those who had invested money in the venture, making Bradford much more of a redistributor of wealth than Baio would have you believe.Also, it's not accurate to say that Bradford ""founded this country"". The Plymouth Colony was not the first American colony, or even the first British colony in what is now the United States. It wasn't the largest British colony in the region, either, being dwarfed by the Massachusetts Bay colony.Also, it's a bit laughable for Baio to talk about how we need to get back to being ""one country"", without ethnic factions. In reality, ethnic minorities are much better integrated today than at any point in our history, and until relatively recently, ethnic minorities were explicitly excluded from many American communities.I can't really comment on anything he said after the 1:30 mark, because that's all I could stomach."

83,"I'm thinking one is being specific about just ""work emails"" while the other is being more specific about ""classified information"". I think they are both correct technically, and it seems as though Hillary is trying to confuse the issue, but the FBI suggests there was no evidence of criminal intent to act upon.From the [State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/88404.pdf) (published in 2005 and in place during Clinton's tenure): >It is the **Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations** be conducted on an authorized [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information.From a [State Department cable](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2015/03/05/state-department-cable-june-28-2011/) sent to all diplomatic and consular posts in 2011, and signed by Clinton:>Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.This quote about it being '[a serious breach](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html)' from the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration is interesting:>It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business.My understanding Policy allowed her to maintain a private email address, as long as correspondence was still handled on government servers, which is I believe what Colin Powell did. But she held everything off site on private servers, managed by her employees who did not all have proper clearance to handle  classified info. This is explicitly against department regulations. The department of SOS that is in charge of validating email set ups never received a request from Hillary's team about her private server set up. They said that if they had received a request it would have been denied.The thing I believe most of us who have been responsible for classified information in the past, what we are concerned with is the visible double-standard: in that, if any of us at a ""lower than cabinet-level"" post had merely been accused of, what she had been proven to be complicit in...we would have been put in irons and doing the perp walk from Day One of the investigation. So somehow, because she is a Presidential candidate, and a former Secretary of State, because she was, ahem, extraordinarily careless in her OPCON, she walks on a technicality. The normal, day-to-day person who handles classified information would get 5-10 in Leavenworth for doing the same thing, and potentially a lot longer if intent was proven. And anyone who has been granted access to TS/codeword or above information can testify to this. (Remember, she had TS/SAP access.)It sickens me to my heart, that not only did she do it, but it appears that she will get away with it, and there is a percentage of the country that is STILL willing to vote her into the Presidency, after she has willfully sold, or allowed to be sold, our countries highest level security information to the highest bidder. We don't know now what serious and irreconcilable damage has been done to this country's security...but we will know in the near future. Mark my words."

At least based on the article, and only the article. No outside reference or actual GOP Platform doc.>The platform demands that lawmakers use religion as a guide when legislating, stipulating “that man-made law must be consistent with God-given, natural rights.”That doesn't follow, based on the quote.    Just because it's using ""god-given"" does not mean 'religion as a guide'. In that sentence, 'god-given' has no real meaning beyond maybe as an adjective thing. You could replace it with ""inherent"" or whatever, and it'd mean the same thing. You could remove 'god-given' completely and the meaning stays the same.The other ones ... probably pretty spot on.There are two takeaways from the article though:    1) the GOP is some regressive dipshittery     2) there are Republicans actively fighting to progress their party on certain social aspects (e.g.; dude actually called out the IS-GOP connection of attacking gays)"

It's all about how local sheriffs are constantly being called by anonymous tipsters to investigate the local Mosque, only to find that there's nothing alarming going on.The one exception is a small town police chief in Georgia, who is convinced that his local Muslim enclave is up to no good, despite the fact that there has never been a single documented act of violence attributed to any member of the local Muslim community.[removed]Yes, there are [terror training camps in America.](http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/militia_m.html) It's scary.If there are, the FBI will WACO their asses. Worry not even if they do exist.Yes, there have been, and probably are currently.As mentioned below, we know that there are groups dedicated to overthrowing the U.S. government who train regularly... the right wing militias.We also know than you could interpret the flight school that provide limited flight instruction to the 9/11 hijackers could qualify (there was aplace that trained terrorists).Lastly, in 2007, 6 men were arrested for planning an attack on Fort Dix in New Jersey, and who apparently would go out in the woods in Pennsylvania to train for this, so they camped, and trained, for terrorism in Pennsylvania. Addendum: Also, the people who were arrested for planning the attack on Ft. Dix actually filmed themselves, then asked someone at a Circuit City to transfer it to DVD for them... and that was when the FBI was contacted. Not the shiniest ornaments on the mental Christmas tree...[removed][removed]"

87,"In order to be indicted under the 3 statutes that are involved you need to be grossly negligent or have intent.  People get that confused with strict liability and regular negligence.  As an attorney, I get this but think it's important to understand the difference so here goes:  I run over your dog because I'm not paying attention and being careless.  Am I going to be prosecuted?  Well, if it's a strict liability standard then yes, I'll be prosecuted and found guilty because I ran over your dog.  If it's a negligence standard then yes, I'll be prosecuted and found guilty because I was careless.  If it is a gross negligence standard I will only be charged or found guilty if I was texting and drinking coffee when running over your dog.  If it is an intentional standard I will only be charged or found guilty if I was aiming for your dog.As to what a reasonable prosecutor does and why that is important --  reasonable prosecutors are supposed to look at their evidence and the law to see if they have a real likelihood of proving their case and getting a conviction.  If your evidence isn't good enough then you're not supposed to drag someone through a criminal trial or tie up the courts even if you don't like that person and/or think they did something wrong.  Judges really, really don't appreciate prosecutors who try for a hail mary pass by filing a case like this that the judge just needs to throw out because its not a good case.  Comey has the reputation of being tough and good at what he does. If he doesn't think he had the ability to successfully prosecute than I believe him.This was discussed at length in a [posting on Neutral Politics.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4rjdxc/is_it_true_that_there_have_not_been_prosecutions/) The gist is that it requires intent for it to be a crime. No intent = no crime.I'd like to add a follow-up: I've heard many people say that what she did is something dozens of others in similar positions had been doing for years without getting in any trouble. Is that accurate?I don't know, but I do have a strong sense that she was treated very, very differently by this administration from others who did things that were, arguably, analogous. [Here's a rant](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/05/washington-has-been-obsessed-with-punishing-secrecy-violations-until-hillary-clinton/) by Greenwald, who thinks similarly.For me, the question isn't whether she broke a law, or how much she should or shouldn't be punished, because of the nature and circumstances of what she allegedly did. For me, the question is whether this administration is guided by anything like a sense of proportionate justice in situations like this, or whether it is mere self-serving, self-protecting favoritism.From my comment here, I'm sure it's obvious which one of those options I think it is.Fun read. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/rich-lowry-clinton-trump-rigged-214019#ixzz4DgjB671pI came here merely to mention Colbert because of the word Truthiness. OkimdonenowFrom my understanding of what Comet said, she broke laws but there wasn't enough proof of harm and the repercussions to Mrs. Clinton would be far to minor anyway."
88,"The house posts expenses for Benghazi investigation and others I assume. Last I saw Benghazi had totalled 7mil with 2mil by Dems on committee vs 5mil by Repubs. Here is link https://benghazi.house.gov/reportsI'd disagree with you on the statement she was found to have nothing to do with them. At least the email scandal and Benghazi she both was intimately involved with and had made statements that don't match up with what was found. Objectively there were huge concerns that required oversight and investigation regardless of the letter after her name. It seems like a lot of money but it is those agencies' roles to investigate and provide oversight. I'd be interested to see any argument that they shouldn't have been investigated. In comparison to commonly highlighted gov waste this spending is very small.The investigation wasn't a failure, its intent was to gather evidence and determine the most appropriate response, which it did.It may not have had the outcome you wanted but it achieved its goals.I disagree with all of your premises. she didn't have no involvement in these issues, she was actually very involved in each of them. I disagree that she was found to have done nothing wrong, she was found to have made many mistakes they just weren't declared criminal and warranting a prosecution. Lastly I disagree entirely that an investigation that found no wrong doing in the end was never worth codifying in n the first place. That is exactly the kind of investigation we want to conduct."
89,"CNN [made this claim](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/news/companies/donald-trump-bankruptcy/) in August 2015.**Edit**: Also, Politifact rated a similar claim [Mostly True](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/). However, that one was about whether his companies filed for bankruptcy ""four times"" (as it happens, Politifact accounted for *six* bankruptcies, although it points out that the blame cannot be placed solely at Trump's feet - the entire casino industry was hit hard during those years).Also, CNN Money has [echoed](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/news/companies/donald-trump-bankruptcy/) Hillary's claim.There doesn't seem to be any website i can find that outright verifies or checks this exact claim, but given that it has been mirrored from a few different sources and doesn't seem to really be disputed, it would seem to be correct. And given that, in this particular claim, the blame isn't being *explicitly* placed on Trump, it seems like it's a pretty safe bet that this one is **True**.I'll give others here a few days to respond with any factual evidence to the contrary.**Edit**: Okay, calling it.I am so glad she is talking about politics and real issues that affect voters."
90,"To give others here a shortcut, [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/4/723) is the AAP article where they make this claim. Apparently, the study they cite which backs up this claim is the following:> 16. Larzelere RE. A review of the outcomes of parental use of nonabusive or customary physical punishment. Pediatrics. 1996:824–828They apparently have this study available for download [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/98/4/824), but doing so apparently requires signing in to the website, which I can't do at this time.Unless another study calls this one into question, it seems like this is pretty well supported, as far as I can tell.**Edit**: It's been a few weeks now, and no one has countered this claim. I'll leave this up a few days more, but unless someone has some evidence to the contrary, I'm going to mark it as **True**.**Edit 2**: Okay, calling this one. No one seems to dispute this claim, and the source of the claim seems to be citing studies that confirm it."
91,"Okay, we really do encourage posters not to post lists - it makes it impossible to give it a flair, given that it's almost always a mixed bag. However, going across this regardless:> Before Obama there was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.It's uncertain what the author considers an ""outlandish"" presence (though I can guess), but the Muslim population in the US in 2007 was an estimated 2.35 Million in 2007, before Obama was elected, [according to a Pew Research Poll](http://www.pewresearch.org/2007/05/22/muslim-americans-middle-class-and-mostly-mainstream/) out of roughly 301 Million total population at the time. This works out to 0.7%Comparatively, Pew [estimates](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/06/a-new-estimate-of-the-u-s-muslim-population/) that in 2015, the Muslim population in the US is an estimated 3.3 million, out of a 322 million estimated total population, accounting for just over 1% of the population. So the Muslim population in America has risen, but not by much proportionally, and it is still very much a minority here.> All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools.There are no laws requiring this, and while there are undoubtedly college courses studying religion that include Islam, that's not really what the author is implying.> Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.The first amendment of the US constitution forbids government-backed institutions from respecting *any* religion, and that pretty clearly includes the teaching of religion in public schools. However, that same amendment also forbids the US government from interfering with the right of individuals to practice their religion, in schools or out of them. And as before, there are of course also college courses specifically for studying religion, Christianity, and the bible, though that's a different topic altogether.Also, private schools can and do teach Christian doctrine and the bible all they want.> All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses.I don't know if the law has specifically made allowances for this practice, but it again seems in keeping with the first amendment, which allows anyone to practice their religion as they see fit.> All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.There's no law I know of forbidding serving of pork in prisons. However, there are laws in [some states](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-prison-kosher-meals-20150502-story.html) requiring that inmates have the *option* of a kosher meal, which is not just for Muslim inmates but for Jewish inmates as well.> All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.This is so vague it could mean anything. Also, it deserves mention that in America, you can sue anyone for *anything*. You can sue a random stranger for wearing a blue tee shirt if you so desire. It doesn't mean that you'll *win* your lawsuit, or that it won't get thrown out of court for being moronic.> All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.Must allow? There have never been any laws against them. Again, freedom of religion allows people to wear religious garb. And private businesses reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Employers are forbidden from banning employees from wearing religious garb (again, first amendment), unless it interferes with their job. Also, the case of Florida woman [Sultaana Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultaana_Freeman#Florida_Lawsuit) shows that Muslims are not entitled to wear concealing clothing in situations where such concealment is counter-productive to necessary functions such as identification photographs and police mugshot photos.> All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.Again, anyone can sue anyone over anything. Doesn't mean they'll win, and it certainly doesn't make it Obama's fault.> All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in ""anti-Muslim speech"".This appears to be true, though Attorney General Loretta Lynch [quickly backtracked](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/12/lynch-recalibrates-message-on-hateful-speech-216488) those comments. Given the context, it seems likely, as she claims, that the original purpose of her speech was to claim the Justice Department would take action against speech that *incites violence*. Her later comments clarify this position.> All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence.""[Citation Needed]?> All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.What is this in reference to, exactly?> All of a sudden, our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.The government of Iraq that *we* established, before Obama took office, demanded that US troops who opted to stay would be subjected to Iraq's laws, which was deemed an unreasonable demand and pretty much forced our withdrawal. This, again, was a decision made before Obama took office. It was not his decision to withdraw (despite him calling for it), nor was it Bush's. That said, many would alternately point to the lack of stable leadership in the region caused by the deposition of Saddam Hussein to be the real cause of the rise of ISIS. In any case, this is clearly not as simple as the author claims.> All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels,According to [records](http://www.tandfonline.com/action/downloadTable?id=t0002&doi=10.2968%2F066004008&downloadType=PDF), the US stockpile of nuclear weapons was a mere 299 in 1950, and that grew to 12,298 by 1959, and current estimates have them at roughly 5000. So stockpiles have certainly not gone down to 1950 levels, but they are below 1960 levels. However, it bears mention that the US stockpile was back down to under 6000 before Obama took office, so even though he has reduced their number, the majority of this reduction took place before he took office.Also, as an aside, just how many nuclear weapons does our country need? [Studies have shown](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013EF000205/full) that a mere 100 *small* nuclear explosions would be perfectly sufficient to make Earth uninhabitable. What is the purpose of having *thousands* of them?> as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.Obama wasn't advocating for a nuclear-free America. He was advocating for a [nuclear-free world](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/nuclear-weapons-barack-obama). There's a huge difference there.> All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.This is particularly ridiculous, as the Iran deal was specifically made to ensure that Iran *wouldn't* continue nuclear research, and included multiple checks to ensure that would be the case.> All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.For all of the claims of Obama ""apologizing"", none of them have ever proved to be anything more than wild exaggeration.... I'll probably have to check the rest of these later, but so far they are nearly all completely bull.Why would we need to fact check such an obviously false email?All of a sudden white baby-boomers like me are becoming obsolete. All of a sudden my majority privileges are being shared with people I find offensive.All of a sudden the bigotry and narrowmindeness that passed for common sense is being questioned by the ""LIBERAL MEDIA""Bla bla bla, I don't want to share my toys!  WAaaaaa~"
92,"I absolutely without an inkling of doubt saw the video!! I thought to myself I can't wait till it's plastered everywhere on tv.  I had a conversation with my Uber driver 2wks ago, discussing all things insane about Trump. When I mentioned the video she responded with, ""you saw that video?"" I'm just now realizing why she asked  me that with a sort of surprised but affirming reaction..it's bc it's gone, no where to be found!  Itellecual property laws is the reason why these things disappear. Everyone, the next time a controversial damaging video appears, weather you're for or against, we need to find away to record it! Use someone else's phone to video the video if you have to! We then can repost it, even if it's only for a few days  before it gets pulled, we  will still have proof!I saw the video. It was the Oprah interview, possibly shown as a clip inside of a different show. Many of my friends saw it as well. We are all shocked at its disappearance.I'm putting a ~~3.5 BTC bounty on this video, which is about $2500 USD.~~UPDATE: 12/30/16 - Bounty revised to $1000 USD, paid in bitcoin at the current exchange rate at time of delivery. I'm adjusting it because it's after the election, and bitcoin prices are changing rapidly.Someone find this thing. The truth speaks for itself...*as long as it can be seen*!!!Are you misremembering a video? According to Snopes, he never said it: http://www.snopes.com/1998-trump-people-quote/Late to the party but... I did see a brief snippet from an interview within the past 2 months where Donald Trump was asked if he ran for president, from which party would he seek the nomination. His answer was ""The Republican Party because they'll vote for anybody"". It was obviously older, I assumed at the time it was from one of the past elections. He had been coyly flirting with running since 2008 at least. As I remember it the interviewer was out of frame. I also had never seen the meme before reading this post. Things disappearing from the internet may sound like a conspiracy theory but there are businesses who's service is to polish people's/businesses image online, I've heard them advertised on AM radio.I've never felt this feeling of my mind betraying me like it is now. How could I clearly remember hearing his words and now I can't find this fucking video. This memory is so real. I've spoken about it with friends. Fuck. I need to sit down.I was talking to my husband about this, we were both sure we had seen this video and were wondering why the memes all say People Magazine... when we went to go look for it to show a friend we couldn't find it but were glad to find you here and all of these other folks that have had the same experience. If someone I actually trusted, really wanted to ""prove"" that it ""never happened"" they'd have to bust out their private collection of like recorded VHS tapes and watch the whole interview with me at this point. Anyone have Grandma's old VHS collection?Your not going mad, the internet has been scrubbed. Check the publishing date on this post on the american.http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/10822-trump-is-right-republicans-are-stupidI faintly remember seeing it in a video. But when the whole debunking came around then I thought I was wrong. Seeing that other people remember a video of it makes me question everything.FIRST OF ALL: If anything were to happen to me, I have made it clear to certain parties that this video will be posted.Yes, this video exists, and I will have access to it in a matter of days. For those of you that cite ""unreliable memory"", I don't believe that argument holds up when the memory is, say, merely a few days old. I'm not sure who started the lie that this video doesn't exist and it was actually quote in People's magazine, but as the OP mentions, it's a tactic. This is a cover-up, something that we shouldn't be surprised of in this day and age (e.g. the corruption that came to light from Hillary's campaign).That being said, I don't intend on posting video because I believe DJT's disreputable campaign was a successful attempt at manipulating the masses (though every candidate does this to various extents), and someone that stands up to the corrupt agendas of the two elite parties could be what this country needs. I've never been a conspiracy theorist, and I don't blindly support either party. Before this video and certain other pieces of information came to light, I disliked Trump and Hillary both for different reasons.I do believe that Donald Trump intends on subverting the GOP and pushing his own agenda forward, which will neither be strictly liberal nor conservative. For those people that contend he has major personality defects, I'd implore them to look into LBJ, who was a narcissistic, disrespectful man who did wonders for the country. We all would like to think that someone that thinks and acts like an honest human being would be a good leader, but I'm not sure if I believe that anymore.At any rate, it's possible that I'll change my mind or be persuaded to post the video. I have it made it clear that this video will be posted if certain events were to take place, however.You're right: Either there's a global internet conspiracy between all the most powerful entities on the internet, working together to protect Donald Trump, or you're remembering wrong.This sort of suggestion isn't unusual at all. There's a common hoax (as demonstrated by the snopes article) claiming that Donald Trump said this exact quote in a magazine interview. A small percent of people are remembering it as if he said it in a televised interview.It doesn't take a ""psychoanalyst"" to figure this out.the video was maybe 10 mins max.  it was mid 90s.  not a recognizable interviewer.  maybe US weekly, or USA network?  i believe it was a female and she asked him some random hypotheticals about being president.  and he let slide that he'd run as a repub because theyre too dumb to get it.  i know this video is out there, Please someone PM a linkI remember seeing this originally way back in the day.  I thought I remembered it from The Howard Stern Show actually back when it was on TV before he moved to XM radio...  I may be mistaken of course as to the show but that statement is something that stuck in the back of my mind and CERTAINLY did happen.  You're totally not crazy.I watched this video myself. It was either 60 minutes or Oprah Winfrey. What he said was if he ever ran for president he'd do it as a republican because they have the dumbest voters.I shared it to Facebook and now the video is nowhere and I just found this Reddit post about it. WOWI found this video, saying he loves the poorly educated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0 Still hunting for the other one though... Never stop fighting, guys. We are about to see some fucked up shit.Alright guys, i just spend the night drinking beer with my mates and taking about life and politics. Within this conversation we transgressed to the american presidency and I cited this video i saw a few month ago of trump saying that he would be a candidate of the republican party, as they eat up everything that foxx news puts out. Now i am trying to find the video just to show it to them for a laugh and I realize that this seemingly open space is actually censored TO THE MAX. How is it possible that i cannot find this video ANYWHERE? Ive seen it like a few weeks ago - with my own eyes. Now its obliterated from the internet... WHAT THE FUCK Do you guys realize what this means ? In the grand scheme of things? WE ARE FUCKEDI SAW THE VIDEO AND I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE! I FUCKING SAW IT!I have discovered that the video was aired on April 25, 1988 at 4pm. I think it's important that we find this video. Does anyone have any thoughts? Is there a complete Oprah collection available for purchase?I definitely saw it too. It was the Oprah interview and it was shortly after the current 2 - 3 minute version cuts off. She asked him, ""How would you win if you ran?"" and he went into it. I don't remember him saying anything about Fox specifically.But I am 100% certain he said ""dumb Republicans"" and ""tell them what they want to hear"". That's all I remember.I remember being stunned.But what's scary is how much this proves how fragile the internet is.At the time, I think I was most surprised that it only got a few hundred thousand views -- this was when he was making headlines. That struck me as weird.But what's interesting is we have a video that thousands of people (some in this thread) remember seeing, and now there is no trace of it.The scary thing about it though is the way it disappeared. If it just vanished, it would resurface. But what people have done is re-uploaded an edited version and then falsely spread the rumor that he said it in People magazine (which is genius if you think about it).  Because the latter can be proven to be patently false, and the Oprah video is now an edited version of the previous one...it seems like it never existed and we are all just cuckoos.i remember this too.  i saw the video and shared it on FB.  it has been systematically eliminated from youtube because it is damning.  SOMEONE must have archived this video.  it does exist.  dont fall for this mandela effect BS.There was a video. It was in the Oprah interview from 1988, but you're right. They have now chopped up the video to edit out that part. I have been searching for weeks trying to find the uncut full interview. It no longer exists. Since Oprah and Donald are besties, I assume that has something to do with it.To all those saying it's from an '88 Oprah interview...PLEASE STOP.  You remember incorrectly.  Fox News didn't exist in 1988.  I'm a progressive, but let's not do this to ourselves.  This is what the other side does...reinforce a lie until it becomes a type of ""truth"".  Let's be honest and admit there is something wrong here.  Fox News wasn't around in 1988, so either it's a misquote or it's NOT from that edited Oprah video.And for those of you claiming ""conspiracy"" at the Oprah video, wise up.  The internet did not exist in the 80's, so no one was uploading every episode of Oprah from back then.  I'm sure there is a bunch of stuff from daily/talk/news shows from the 80's that was just never relevant enough for someone to dig up 7 years later to upolad on a 56k dial up connection lolSo I've spent the better part of a few hours looking for the video, but to no avail yet.If anyone takes up the search, the Oprah video interview was originally aired on April 25th, 1988, and it appears that the snipets we get on YouTube are not the complete interview.  However, that may be a wild goose chase since it may have been a different interview altogether with a different interviewer.I saw the video and posted it on Facebook , I also put it on my time line and now it's as if it never existed!No. I watched the video and shared it on my facebook. It was taken down. I thought it was bc an angry trump voter complained. Now that I'm looking for it, all I can find is this. I know I'm not crazy and it's messed up they would hide this.holy shit, i'm glad i'm not the only one looking for it, i've confirmed that it was an Oprah interview in 1988, but a lot of the youtube videos have been edited or removed lolApril 25, 1988 Oprah interview. Someone buy the boxset lmaoI absolutely saw this video.  There is no question at all.I saw this video a couple years ago, and i saw it just as Trump officially announced  his run. I never doubted i was right. I knew i saw the Oprah video. Its a shame, that Trumps people took care of that, and left just the good clips. The original clip was more than 10 minutes, and featured doing hid usual Trump arrogance bit, it was quite a spectacle to say the least.There is no doubt, that he did say the quote. We have to find that full episode.https://www.google.pt/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dl8ujcHSLdjs&tbm=vidThe original search...the video was shortned and The youtube channel closed....I only found it a few times in the past because I stumbled upon it while searching and reading articles about Trump.  Doing a particular search for it only seems to turn up this Reddit thread or lots of links about the People Mag non-factual quote rather than the video.  I don't recall it having the kind of heading that is easily searchable using words from the quote.  It must be somewhere though even if many have been erased.  My son who is an academic and a Trump supporter has also seen it.  I was talking to him about it earlier today.  I like others was surprised it wasn't in the media light.[deleted]First of all, he did say that and I saw the video over a year ago.  IT WAS THE 1988 INTERVIEW ON THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW AND ANYONE WHO THINKS IT WAS A DIFFERENT INTERVIEW ARE REMEMBERING INCORRECTLY. But it's okay, because we are still on the same team.  These important facts prove it's existence:  1) ALL clips from that interview that I could find were either uploaded or edited in 2015/2016 (This is perhaps the most damning evidence, as no one could believe it wasn't posted until 2015 if it was from 1988)  2) NONE of the clips of that 1988 Oprah interview show the full interview, they all cut out right before Trump says ""If I were to run, I would run as a Republic because they are the dumbest group of voters in the country. They will believe anything you say!""  3) This article right here, look when it was published. If Trump never said that quote, what is Sam Blumenfeld referencing? (If he was still alive, I'm sure he would confirm the quote) http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/10822-trump-is-right-republicans-are-stupid    These might not exactly prove that it exists, but certainly support the case:  1) Literally, thousands of people claim to have seen a video of Trump saying that quote  2) The emergence of the fake meme. I'm sure the Trump team had something to do with this, they distorted the quote, changed the year, and attributed to the wrong source. This way, whenever anyone brings up the ORIGINAL quote, people will just point at the fake meme and say it was proven false. Very clever, but we saw through this tactic.  3) This link shows that an 11 minute version of the video was posted to Youtube in October 2016 and the account that posted it was terminated. The original video was 11 minutes long. This doesn't prove it, but does suggest, that the video is taken down whenever anyone tries to repost it. (Remember, the interview is also covered under copyright law)https://www.google.pt/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dl8ujcHSLdjs&tbm=vid    Feedback appreciated, I am new here on Reddit.  edit: I joined Reddit specifically to help get to the bottom of this.I saw the video too. My ex-wife (who I get along well with) forwarded me the link.  I watched it and thought, 'wow, what a gaff, this is going to haunt him in this race.'  After that I didn't think much of it.  Today I tried to find it and saw all these claims from Snopes and others saying that it was false - he never said such a thing in People Magazine (or any other publication or interview).  Indeed, it's been scrubbed from the net.  I was never one to believe that the powerful had 'that' much power over the net, but after seeing this it appears they do indeed.I saw this video months ago and couldn't believe he said it and was running as a republican.  It is real and it exists somewhere.  It was on a talk show and it was either David Letterman, Johnny Carson or Jay Leno... It was a short clip when he was asked if he would ever consider running for president and his response was that he would run as a republican because they are the dumbest voters out there.  The quote that was attributed to People was the quote I heard him make in that taped interview.  IT IS REAL, I have been looking for it as well and it has disappeared.i absolutely almost without doubt remember his voice here is what i remember(roughly)oprah:'so if you were to run what party would you run for'trump:'if i were to run as president i would run as republican because republicans are the dumbest group of voters'-and i remember it cutting off somewhere thereHoly shit, just had the same experience. Can't believe this !60 minutes!!!it was 60 minutes! i watched it months ago and i was just going to find it to show someone. for the hour ive been looking into this dissapearing video and found this threadI saw ithttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GZpMJeynBegI remember seeing this video. Searched for it today to post it and could not find it. I'm now seeing a lot of ""myth busted"" posts about a People's Magazine meme ...but I don't remember the meme; I specifically remember what Donald Trump said and how he said it in a video interview. Someone must have the source.You yourself being a student of psychology should know how unreliable and pliable human memory actually is and how easily it can be manipulated. There have also been cases of false memories en masse, people are more influenced then you may think, especially when time is a factor or when a person/s of authority are involved...Other factors that should be considered is social media/news sites/ blogs/message boards etc where people can come together to discuss their ideas, opinions and of course their perceived memories. Just look what happens with memes, a joke, creepypastas, they spread like a virus. With the interconnect world we live in it's easy to spread these ideas, more than ever, even false memories. One person convinces another person of their reality which also in turn affirms their perceived reality, and the more people that are convinced to this perceived reality, the more their beliefs are reinforced. Some people call this the 'Mandela Effect' (after the perceived idea that Mandela died in prison) and have convinced themselves that they are living in an alternate realty. I believe someone once said 'If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.' - Adolf Hitler: and he is correct...Not to be all conspiratorial, but after seeing this post-election interview with Oprah, the disappearance of that video makes a little more sense:http://buzz.blog.ajc.com/2016/11/12/oprah-trump/Honestly the video doesn't exist. If it did, it would be out there.  It would be used by Hillary.  The DNC has many resources to dispose of, something like that would have sunk his campaign.**If it existed it would have been found already**I watched it with my boyfriend. I tried to find it again to show it to my dad and it was nowhere to be found.another thought, from now on anytime you guys find something you believe you should save, copy it to your computer and rename it for good reason and email it to yourself, or even better back it up on  somewhere that has no connection to the internet, yes it can be disappeared from your own computer. to save from youtube: type 'ss' before youtube in the link to the video in address bar and hit enter ( https://www.ssyoutube.com/watch?v=5DDnvRjCU9A ). for those that just discovered that this video is gone and are shocked that the possibility the internet can be scrubbed, yes, it can be scrubbed easily. here is an example of the power of technology and the lack of freedom we truly have because if it: i read an article this morning in the nytimes that chinese pay per use cell phones sends your texts, location, who you talk to China every 72 hours. wake up call people. also, it is documented that the cia created Facebook. that is the truth. face book saves everything you do, the worst example of this imo is FB even saves everything you type into the update status box before it is posted, even if you delete it and never post it, in other words it key logs everything. think about it, FB is basically your psyche for them to see, as a friend put it: the closest thing to mind reading they have. now you know. think i am full shit? then show me the video.Was thinking of letting this one go, but... First of all I'm Swedish so I've just been a spectator in this election, but of course it's been a big issue here in Sweden as well.A couple of weeks ago i saw the meme for the first time. My initial reflection was: ""Why are they crediting the quote to People's Magazine in 1998 when he said it in a TV-show, most likely a few years earlier than that?"". The qoute itself was accurate, at least the important part about how he would run as a republican because their voters are the dumbest. I saw the meme a couple of more times, and every time with the incorrect credit to PM. Didn't think much of it until an article in a Swedish newspaper was critisizing Facebook of spreading false information during the election, and as an example they brought up the meme with this quote. False quote? Wtf? I saw and heard Trump say it on a videoclip from a TV-show months ago when they hadn't decided who were going to be the parties candidates yet, so why are they saying the qoute is false?Made a quick search for the videoclip but all that came up was plenty of articles saying that it was fake and that Trump never made an interview with PM in 1998. Well, I know that it wasn't from PM because I saw it on a videoclip, but why can't I find it? Eventually I ended up here, and this is my view:1. My memory of seeing Trump saying this in a videoclip is very clear. I remember his attitude and body language as he said it, and I would say he looked to be in his 40's. I cannot believe I have seen a written qoute and from that qoute made this memory of a videoclip up by myself, and since I'm far from not the only one with the same experience I'd say the video exists.2. If I saw it in Sweden the clip (or the link to the clip) must have been well spread, so how on earth is it possible the clip isn't around? Is it really possible to erase a videoclip to an extent that it's gone? And if I saw it, wouldn't a Trump critic like Jon Stewart, or at least a friend of his, seen it and it would have been talked about on his show? This tells me there has never been a video.But, since my memory of seeing the clip is so real I still believe the clip exists, and there are a number of things that would be so weird if the clip never existed:a) If the only thing that has ever existed was the meme with the qoute, why can I instantly, the first time I see it say the credit to an interview with PM in 1998 is incorrect? And if I had seen the meme with qoute before and simply forgotten it, why question the credit as it would have been the same?b) If the only thing that ever existed was the meme and we have all made the video up in our minds, why are all the old links broken? Why do they not simply lead back to the meme and we can all just wonder how we made the video up from this meme?c) If there was a fake video with the quote overlaying a still picture of Trump, or a fake video with Trump somehow saying this and that is how we made this memory up, then why is that video gone? Surely it would still be there as an explanation why people remember a video and not a qoute from a meme, and it would have been picked down to pieces and exposed as a hoax?No matter what I find this truly disturbing:If I'm correct and the clip exists it has somehow been erased from the internet. That is a really scary thought, and who knows what else can be erased the same way?If I'm wrong and this video is only showing in my mind it's equally scary how easily a fake memory can be planted with me and so many others at the same time.I can only hope that this matter can be settled, either by the clip showing up or someone giving a plausible explanation to how so many people, totally independant of each other, can have the memory. I mean, we all need to have created a bright memory of seeing and hearing Trump say this in a clip from a TV-show, sitting in a sofa, when all that ever existed was a meme with the qoute in print saying it was from an interview in PM in 1998. Really?To sum it up: I think the clip will show up eventually. Someone has it on VHS or their phone/computer and it will find it's way to the media, but you know what? I think even if the clip would have been public during the campaign it wouldn't have mattered. Trump siad and did so many things that should have eliminated him early in the primaries, but he still got elected in the end. Hearing and seeing him say he some 30 years ago thought republican voters were dumb wouldn't have changed thier minds in any way.And on the upside, at least we know now he sometimes tells the truth. ;)Trump bought the rights to the video from Harpo. So he now owns it. That's why we can't find it.I think it's funny that republicans will dispute the fact of global warming and other scientific findings when it doesn't suit their agenda, but then demand ""proof"" in another scenario (this one) that isn't to their liking. I think it's funny that republicans believe a claim there was a voter-counting conspiracy against Trump where there's no evidence of it, but are quick so say there's no such video that many people (including me) have seen, that we must be making it up, because there's no evidence. Funny, funny people they are....I absolutely did see this video. Now with all the fake news campaign by the democrats and Trump trying to censor news, it really freaks me out. Snopes says it's false as well. I have noticed they are not always accurate but this one confirms it for me. I don't get it. I hope that video can be found. It does make you think your going crazy. Thanks for this post.Has anyone else out there not given up yet? This video was suppressed Bc it would have been Drumpfs Achilles heel. We must find it !NONE of you saw such a video. If said video had existed, it would be out there, still.You're falling victim to your own confirmation bias. It happens to everyone. It's very typical with the human brain.I can't stand Trump or ANYTHING he stands for...but if you're going to hate someone, hate him/her for LEGITIMATE reasons, not fake ones you manufactured in your own mind.Otherwise you just prove yourselves to be the idiots.Good luck with all that.What the fuck, I can't find it anymore either! Next time I see shit like this, I'm downloading the videos. :sIt wasn't some dumbass magazine either, it was a video interview.I'm late to this. Anything change /u/jakerose632? So what can we narrow it down to so ppl can look? So It was actually on Oprah in 1998? So wouldn't it be in the Oprah show's DVD/VHS set pre-election?I saw it too.It was a video. I'm fairly certain. There were windows in the background and he was standing in front of his desk.I hope this video sees the light at some point, Hillary's team must know about it and I hope they considered searching itI saw the video. It really happened. It was an old video, an interview. I saw it on YouTube.I KNOW that I saw this video.It's not the Oprah 1988 video.in my mind the interview was conducted outdoors, somewhere that looked a bit like a skate park..Something random like that. It seemed like an off the cuff news interview or something.I saw the video! Can't find it now to save my life, but I saw it!I saw it too. After researching I noticed all of the Oprah interviews with Trump were all posted or edited a year ago. This video was in 1988 yet doesn't exist before 2015. There's videos of him spanning decades and posted since YouTube first existed but not this one. Obviously it was taken down or edited sometime within the year.I absolutely saw the video and wondered why it wasn't more widely published, but did not think about it further. Then I saw it cited as a magazine quote- which I thought was wrong- and searched and got to Snopes which said the magazine article claim was false but did not mention the video. Since Snopes is pretty thorough I thought that was even stranger, searched further and have now been motivated to sign up for Reddit. I am not one for conspiracy theories, but this is really strange.And I'm Portuguese, me, my girlfriend and my dad saw the VIDEO, more than once!... I don't have a reason to lie about it... I'm expecting that someone will come over here, and start insulting, saying we are crazy...I don't care...you know why? Because one thing my father thaught me...""Do the right thing, even if no one in the world is doing it..."" (sorry about any errors but english is not my first language!)I saw this video at least I'm pretty damn sure I did. I was looking it up myself and this was one of the onlyplaces i could find anything even relevant. Can it really be possible for it to have disappeared entirely? Is this a case of the Mandela Effect? But I'm SURE I saw that video!I saw the video way back when the primaries started and instantly showed it to my wife who remembers just about everything to the very small detail. She remembers it and when I told her they took off the video and showed that even Snopes placed their facts on it she thought I was joking at first. That video was the original reason I thought Trump was definitely running for Hilary to win, but Trump did win and has gone back on 2 or 3 policies already. I wanted Bernie, but I don't think it will be as crazy as a lot of liberals think it will be with Trump in office. One thing I promise is, that video definitely existed an was absolutely removed.Any luck finding the video?Is there a way to make this thread PERMANENT? If it's true, they're deleting all evidence for the interview and making it look like it's all a hoax. I'm serious, all search results turn up with ""debunked/untrue/hoax"" etc.I am absolutely certain that I saw this video a few months ago. I'd never seen the picture/meme with the quote until today, when I tried to find the video to share with someone. I think it may have been cut from this WNET/PBS 11th Hour interview, as it looks and sounds like I remember it (dim lighting, Trump facing right). WNET is a New York public media channel (http://www.wnet.org/). I don't think there was any reference to Fox News in the interview quote, so the timing works out. The interview also has an awkward topic jump at 3:43, where a clip could have been taken out. This would have been a public television show, so perhaps that feeds into why it was deleted? Does anyone have access to PBS archive footage? https://www.youtube.com/watchv=WojdgD8CB9g&feature=youtu.beI'm glad I'm not alone in remembering this video! Either there's a conspiracy I'm not alone in seeing or I'm crazy and still not alone! I hope that video pops up somewhere & is posted in this thread!!I saw the video and would probably be questioning my own recollection if it weren't for so many friends and family who did also. Our memories are not a meme. This Koolaid is beginning to taste rancid.How in the hell is this video completely removed from the internet?! This is 2016... We need the rest of the interview!!!!Who has Tor? Could this video be buried in the iceberg?I'm so certain of seeing this video, but apart from the fact that it really should be possible to find if it existed another thing is disturbing:If the meme is fake and an attempt to take focus of the video by crediting People's Magazine, why use a still picture from the show most people claim to be the TV-show it originated from? Doesn't make sense to me...Unbelievable. I watched that video early in the primaries on YouTube and now it's gone. I 100% know this video existed and now it 100% disappeared from the internet.Okay, if you're claiming that the source of the purported quote is misattributed, can you give any leads on where it *did* come from? Who was interviewing him? What was the TV show? What else was said aside from that line that's become a part of the meme?Yes !  I saw the same video and when I went to search for it this morning to prove for a friend- it's GONE!  Wth!  How is this even legal????  How can a video just go missing!??!Anyone found any more clues to this video? Was telling my friend about it yesterdat and had no idea that its been removed from the internet. 100% remember watching the video, and came across an article (whilst looking for the video today) claiming the video never existed which made me suspicious and curious. I guess this just shows another example of propaganda and leading elite herders attempts of maintaining control over their sheep. Hopefully we wont all be tracked down and assassinated or brain-wiped for our knowledge.I saw it too.  I didn't read it anywhere, I remember Donald Trump speaking the words on a video interview and recounted as much to a friend just days later.  It's obvious what's happened here.  The Donald launched a cleanup campaign to purge this video from the internet.  With his money, it looks like you can do that and do it well.I personally saw it, because a friend of my re-posted it. Hillary's camp has the power to find it again.I also remember seeing this in a video and I could have sworn it was part of his interview with Oprah in 1988. Crazy that this has been searched so much and so many people remember it happenening yet all evidence of it seems to be gone.How is it we all remember? Is this the Mandela effect playing with our heads? I just know I watched it. I watched it a couple times and shared it on my Facebook. but according to this douche we are all just crazy and havnt taken some kind of pill. Haha. I think we just aren't trump brainwashed.This has bothered my mind for a while now, i saw i too, and spent hours looking for it. What i think we all could do is, send this thread to some known figures online e.g. youtube channels, which has the power to share it with a larger audience, maybe one person out of a million has the video downloaded.If we could do this, the video would be all over the news, seriously!This is f__ing strange..  Have never seen this ever before...  The thing is gone from everywhere....I saw this video, too, AND it was used in an attack ad on TV. Where did it go? Russian interference?I saw this myself aswell!? A couple of times and showed it to my friends. Where is this video!?!? Someone needs to have it.i remember seeing it and I was trying to prove a friend wrong and couldn't find it. Hopefully it comes out soon. The video on YouTube is way shorter. I remember seeing it super early before he was actually the only candidate. It was on an Instagram page and YouTube.I saw it too! And now it's ereased from the Internet. That's how the powerful people works. They delete it and who ever saw is believed to be a crazy person by the people who didn't see.But here it's a good place because united us, people who saw Trump it's just a strategist, not a radical Republican. And maybe that's good news.What you think?Sooooo????? We're just going to forget about this?I believe I have found the video but it cuts out just before he says it. I remember distinctly that the interviewer goes on to ask for which party he would run for and then he answers with that remark. Can anyone find the full interview? https://youtu.be/mCB6RvRojIQI saw the video.  A good few months ago now and I cannot find it anywhere.  I only found out that it can no longer be seen when I re-posted the meme with the quote on my Facebook and someone responded with the current meme that says it he never said it.  I know I've seen the footage.  Was it from the Oprah show?  I just remember that it was some sort of chat show from a few decades ago.  He looked a lot younger anyway.I saw it too.Has anyone found the video yet?  I was disappointed as it's so damming, but not surprised that it would be removed.I remember seeing this video too! wtf...Nope. I've absolutely 100% seen it.It's gotta be on the internet somewhere.I remember thinking about this exact video clip when he was running.wasnt it a 10 min interview with Rona Barrett? lmao i made a reddit account just to join this thread because not being able to find the video is killing me inside.I saw it, during this election period. It was him. He smiled when he said it. Someone find it!!youtu.be/JGeiuCPs6xA  >>>This. This is the link to it (I think) that I tweeted right after I saw the video. Now the link goes to a blank YouTube page. Does anybody know how to decipher YT's link? Disclaimer: it could be something else but I'm 99% sure that was it. I wish I'd written a better description!!http://imgur.com/fvkP8JJ the meme on imgur w/all comments gone!I saw this video online without a doubt. When I watched it 14-24 months ago I noticed that the interviewer had been edited out, except for shots from behind her shoulder...she was blonde, as I recall because at first I thought it might have been Jenny Jones. When I searched for it, after Trump won the Republican nomination, the video had been more-or-less replaced by the fake People Magazine quote. I looked it up on Snopes, and for the first but not the last time I doubted their credibility although I briefly doubted my own memory as well…until my buddy and I talked about it recently and after a Google search, I found myself here.I believe that Trump, the Republican Party or a supporter acting independently paid enough people, enough money to have it scrubbed from the internet...while it would have been devastating during the campaign, if the video surfaced now every Republican would just assume that he was talking about the ""other republicans"" while the radical left might “give him a chance” if they see it. Either way, this video still has to come out.one thought i had here is check your computer cache. it may be there hidden in the bowels.I specifically recall seeing the same video! It wasn't through a Meme that I became familiar with Trump's words. I also tried to YouTube or search for the video but all traces of it has gone away!Does anyone know someone who taped all the Oprah shows, put them on cds, or downloaded them all?I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/conspiracy] [Donald Trump: ""Republicans are Dumb"", why did this video disappear off the internet? (X-Post)](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5e11hx/donald_trump_republicans_are_dumb_why_did_this/)[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*[](#bot)I'm going religious on this one: The video exists until someone can prove it doesn't. =)I remember seeing that image a few months ago. I looked up the oprah interview after and guess what? He never said republicans are dumb. He never said anything about republicans. Even articles from around that time debunked that quote. Hell it's attributed to People Magazine yet there are posters in this thread claiming they saw him say it during the oprah interview. The human memory sucks.In fact if you watch other interviews with him in addition to the oprah interview, his tone and demeanor or whatever is completely different from the supposed quote. He is a lot more tactful than he was during the campaign. It's not something he would say, and if he did say it it would have been a bigger deal, then and now.All I can say is it's scary how easily some people would believe a troll image.One idea as to what has happened is that after the interview in question, Trump insisted (perhaps under copyright law) that those particular comments not be made public because he did indeed have designs on running for office one day and knew it would hurt him. We know what a blunt talker he is; he likely blurted it out without thinking. The media company (Harpo?) is going to honor that, but there were some who had it on tape and it surfaces during the primaries which is when I saw it. Trump damage control swoops in and threatens to sue (sound familiar?) under copyright law. Which, as much as I'd like to see it surface, worries me that the same threat/silencing would happen if one of us here were to locate and offer to share it (publicly on this forum). Holding to my theory, wanna bet there's someone trolling here and searching elsewhere for the big Eureka?I can't remember if it was on the Oprah video or something else.  I've been searching and I came across this video.  To save you some time, don't watch it through - the quote isn't in there, but it may have been in a previous segment of it.  If I remember right, the interview was fairly long and possibly bridged in several parts.  Or after - at the very end the interviewer is pressing him about running in politics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1kFqviAEHwI believe I saw it in the documentary ""Trump: What's the Deal,"" but I'm not sure. The original [Youtube link](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/watch-1991-documentary-donald-trump-didnt-want-anyone-see)  I think I saw it in is dead now...Maybe we someone pursues the hidden corners of the internet? Or just asks anonymous? Or does that open Pandora's box?People Magazine couldn't find anything on it.  It's false.saw they video few weeks ago so these effect are changing even nowBoth John Oliver and a guest on a NPR segment claim that there is no proof of this video existing. It's fake news. This was just a misquote.Everyone I know that has seen it was forwarded the video clip through social media. From what I assume was a YouTube link.Berenstein vs Berenstain?I honestly wonder if the real video does exist. I can't say for certain, but I know a lot of people would swear they saw it. Fair enough. However, I do see how said video (if it exists) could be released in the near future to cause Republicans to riot like the lefties are in CA and OR. Stir it up even more. Increase a call for martial law? Or, just have him go batshit crazy in the name of the GOP, then release the video close to midterms.I saw the video as well!!  There is a copy out there somewhere.. so lets keep this thread alive... share with your friends!he never said that. take your meds."
93,"http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187> In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, the philanthropic enterprise she has overseen with her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Just two months before the deal was finalized, Boeing -- the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the Saudis were especially keen to acquire, the F-15 -- contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to a company press release.> The Saudi deal was one of dozens of arms sales approved by Hillary Clinton’s State Department that placed weapons in the hands of governments that had also donated money to the Clinton family philanthropic empire, an International Business Times investigation has found....> The Clinton-led State Department also authorized $151 billion of separate Pentagon-brokered deals for 16 of the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation, resulting in a 143 percent increase in completed sales to those nations over the same time frame during the Bush administration. ...> American defense contractors also donated to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and in some cases made personal payments to Bill Clinton for speaking engagements. Such firms and their subsidiaries were listed as contractors in $163 billion worth of Pentagon-negotiated deals that were authorized by the Clinton State Department between 2009 and 2012....> In all, governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by Clinton’s State Department have delivered between $54 million and $141 million to the Clinton Foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the Clinton family, according to foundation and State Department records. The Clinton Foundation publishes only a rough range of individual contributors’ donations, making a more precise accounting impossible.Other sources:[Salon](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/31/the_cash_donations_hillary_simply_has_no_answer_for_partner/)[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html)[PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/may/04/joe-scarborough/scarborough-clinton-foundation-broke-its-own-rules/)These articles are pulled from public records of Clinton Foundation and our arms deals.---The text of the linked image only states that one event happened, and then the second event happened. It does not say *because* nor does it say *rewarded* or anything like that. The text of the linked image is correct and factual.Also though, we were doing arms deals with most/all of those countries before that. There was an increase in the dollar amount of the contracts under Clinton, but it may not correlate to the donations.I'm not a Hillary fan at all and welcome any solid evidence against her but... Haven't those countries been buying shit from our defense contractors forever?  Isn't that how we make defense contractors happy while we aren't actually at war?  Aren't weapons our largest export?  I really think we make them buy shit they don't need.  I spent time in Saudi in '93 and their F15s just sit there.  Show me some evidence that these Clinton foundations don't use the money like they advertise.  That should be easy.  I welcome somebody that takes money from other countries to do good things and they then buy shit from us they don't need.   IMO, this is weak.  Looks bad on the surface but weak.Post hoc, ergo propter hocI think its funny people dont know this.  Yes its 100% fact."
94,"this is now and always has been a non-story. many people hear stories passed down by parents, grandparents and great grandparents and take them as gospel absent documentation or proof. theres a few links below and all of them agree that she never used it to gain any standing, gain a job or other benefits. the only time she referenced it was to locate other people with tribal backgrounds and to enter some recipes in a cookbook. the bottom line is she might have cherokee background in her family line but its insufficient to claim the legal status of part-native american, or maybe her distant relatives have it wrong. its all irrelevant and its a complete non issue.But there's not evidence that she doesn't either, and it's gonna get real awkward, real fast if we start denying people their heritage based on lack of evidence and general doubt.If you believe her family story, then her grandmother learned some native American recipes from her family members, and the most likely lied (or was herself misinformed) about the amount of native american blood she had.The truth is it makes no difference, and yes Maddie should have just skipped over it... unless she's got inside track information that Warren is VP pickYeah, she was wrong. Even Warren is trying to move past this and Maddow is doing a massive disservice by bringing it up; I actually can't get over how dumb that was to do a segment on it. This is why they call MSNBC the Fox News of the Left.[The Atlantic covered it, finding that there wasn't evidence to prove that she was Native American, but that it also had no impact in her career.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/is-elizabeth-warren-native-american-or-what/257415/)[A simplified timeline via wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren#U.S._Senate)I'm actually personally, in a very similar situation to Warren.We know for a fact great grandma was a single teenage mom. ""Great grandpa"" came back from some war somewhere, wounded. Town said ""She needs a husband. Kid needs a dad. You need a wife."". Boom. it was done.My grandpa actually lived his whole life without knowing, until the very end of his life, he was scrapbooking, and noticed his birth certificate had the ""wrong"" date on it, and it was before the date on his parent's marriage certificate. Due to the scandal of illegitimacy and her virtue etc, it was all hushed up.My grandma knew way before actually, because my ""great grandpa"" and his brothers had a seizure issue, which my grandma was worried about her husband having, or getting passed on to her kids. One of my great-great aunts came to her one day and told her she didn't need to worry about it, and why. Anyway, there are two likely candidates for who I'm descended from, both farmhands who were known to be a little too close with great grandma. So, either a german guy, or the native guy. It would put me at 1/8-16th native.In retrospect, its pretty obvious, my grandpa and his kids look nothing like his brothers or their kids. My family all has a very stereotypical ""indian"" nose.  I personally can't get tested for this, because it would come through my mom, and the ancestry tests cant switch chromosomes like that. But some of my cousins have talked about it.Why doesn't she just do the DNA test thing?My mom and uncle did it. It's pretty cool. It tells you exactly what you are. I'm 1% black! Maybe I should campaign on that...She should just do it and find out once and for all.I believe that generally 1/16th is the lowest level of actually being to report/claim a bloodline-minority etc..  whether or not there is a law establishing an exact number, I can't imagine why or who would actually decide that number...Full blooded -great-great-Grandparent--great-Grandparent(1/2)--Grandparent(1/4)-- Parent(1/8)--You(1/16) (assuming your family did not marry back into the line pushing the fraction up a generation)Keep in mind that for a lot of folks that relative was already not 100% (heritage of your choosing) because of forced intermarriage/slavery/kidnapping that was a bit more rampant than today.edit:wordingIn Massachusetts, they call her Fauxcahontas.She identifies as part Native American."

96,"I don't think there has ever been a single war where more women than men died. Women often get desk positions in the military even today. And WW2 and WW1 were mainly men going to war and only very few women if any.She was talking to a group of feminists. This statement is 100% false.Is she talking about rape?Here is a starting point:http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-victims-of-war/I served in the Army, thankfully not in war. You people are crazy. Like there's high rates of veterans suicide, that's mostly men. Men die in the wars so that terror never gets here in the first place. Or some of them have to suffer the emotional scarring of being tricked into fighting for a corporation, or just the fact that they watched their friends die. Male veteran homelessness is through the roof. Cases of PTSD and alcoholism are abundant. There's an undertone of male disposability that is prominent in society, some of which currently in here, that's not only expressed by men going to die in war for the good of everyone else, it's emboldened by it. Specifically because their voices are gone. Like male trauma is not even counted, and you have the audacity to say women suffer more from war. That's a western interpretation of this frame, because what war is to us, women have it easy here, thus Clinton being the one to say this is pretty offensive, even though it was over 20 years ago. Globally there's a better case for your/her point, but it's frame is still completely bias and dismissive of the horrors men go through in war. War in itself is bad for women, third world countries and civil wars specifically, but the gravity of a life is lost on this conversation. Men not being there to suffer with them in the first place isn't even included, and it spits on all those who gave up their life, so the ones left would have the right to live, the right to experience more things in this existence. Love, raise kids, and risk suffering from society at that point forward. Men gave up the very opportunity to suffer, it's a bigger price.Check out Dan Carlin's Hardcore History.  The old world loved to exploit the spoils of war.  I would rather die on a battle field than witness any one be raped to death just before it happened to me, but Im just a guy that has never had anything forced into me out of hatred.This is unsourced, but maybe a clue to finding sourced data:""Women and children account for almost 80% of the casualties of conflict and war as well as 80% of the 40 million people in world who are now refugees from their homes.""http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1219-26.htmNo, it's pants-on-head retarded. There is no way to quantify, justify, or prove that. Men by far participate more in the war and they DIE. Yes, women have a hard time losing their husbands and sons, but they do not die near as often. This is just her playing her woman card, because the only valid reason she has for presidency is that she deserves to be the president as a woman.Just as accurate as saying 99,9% of women survive a war compared to a 50 % casualty rate ( that thanks to the reccent efforts of the americans, goes up to 75 % if you just happened to be born male)The argument that you make is that women, because they are still benefittiong from a patriarchal entitlement to be the weak and precious gender that needs to be protected and coddled, never experience the full hardship of war, because most states where feminists are a voice keep females out of of frontline combat.So, if you want to make that argument, be prepared that I will ask you, how many female veterans commit suicide, and how many men. I will ask you, How many women on average survive an engagement, how many men. I will ask you, How many treatment options for females that suffer from PTSD, or any mental health problems are open. I will ask you, how much money has been spent for treatment options that are accessible to males, how much for treatment options that are accessible to females? I will ask how many of them are open to admitting men. I will ask you, who has the higher injury rates among armed forces and civillians combined, men or women. How about the higher self medication rate with alcohol / legal drugs? How about what gets you more of a payout, being the victim of domestic violence, or being a corpse in war?You want to talk victims of war? Be fucking honest about it. I do not deny that women suffer in war, and that living with the memories of war is a fucking horrific thing for anybody. But to say ""being alive is the worst punishment of all"" denies the fact that the rest is, you know, dead. Not alive anymore. That is why the survivors have things like survivors guilt. even they recognise, on a personal basis, that a lot of those who died would have given anything to just have survived. To exclude them from the picture is like saying, oh, yea, it was really bad that he murdered all those people, but look at what he has to live with for the rest of his life. OOh, it is really bad that she poured boiling water on her baby untill it stopped screaming, but I think she is punished enough by havuing to live with that. That is why in every trial, in every judgement, if you have the victim no longer present, or able to testify, you have a person who speaks for them. Who reminds us, that yes, the person is looking pretty sad and small and non threatening now, but I am here to speak for those who can no longer be with us, thanks to the persons action. You want to read her argument rephrased? ""Men have no domestic partners to lose. Men have no partens to lose. Men have no children to lose. Men no longer have homes to flee from. Men will never be able to know an other home. Men can not be refugees from Conflicts, and if they are their victims, most would consider it business as usual. Men can never see their children anymore, much less raise them. Men no longer suffer from crime or domestic violence. Because the men no longer exist. they have ceased to exist when they get drafted, often against their will, in conflicts trhat are not their own to fight. The have been drafted, because their own countries determines, that the value of a mans life is less then the value of a womans life, and we have allways send our men to war. They have ceased to exist when they were moved out of womans sight. They have ceased to exist when politics considers them expendable. They have ceased to exist when they are dead, hoping to their last breath that maybe, just maybe, their death could have some meaning, and maybe the fact that because of them some man woman or child continued to live could give their senseless death some meaning. Men have ceased to exist, because their voices no longer can be heard. Because they are not wanted. It is very easy to focus on women. Especially, if you never had the human kindness in your heart for an other stranger. They say in every man is a warrior waiting to be awakened. I say it differently. In every man, there is a little boy, sared out of his wits. That gets hit end scolded every time he wants to say something, so he retreats in his shell more. he can not find comfort in men, because the other men are scared little boys as well that do not want to show it, for fear of being hit more. So this young boy has ceased to exist. But while the young bo has no voice, and can't voice his feelings, he can imagne, very vividly, what it is to go to war. Because in war, the little boy exists. Because he is expendable. If he refuses to go to war, many countries viciously punish the little boy for not following orders. They lock him up because he refuses to kill other little boys. But the truth is, no matter how well hidden the luittle boy is, the little boy continues to be there. And even if people justify it thousands of times for the little boy, the little boy knows one thing in the depth of his heart. He is expendable, as soon as he picks up a weapon. Life will go on. His girlfriend will find an othjer one, his parents will mourn him a bit, his children will grow up seeing a photo on their desks, if anything. But i he dies, all he will ever be, ever can be, or ever hoped and wanted to be ends that moment. because the second he picked up a weapon, he became expendable. So he knows that the little boys that his superior told him are just as scared as he is, but they are just as expendable. And just by an accident of birth, they could have lived his life. he could have lived theirs. So the little boys, that tossed their lives away because politicians said the war had to be fought, because they were punished if they did not show up to the military, because they were ""whipped into discipline"", that never had a voice or someone that listened to them, that were expendable from the day they were born, hear that a woman says that women are the real losers of war. Sure they are. Because the little boys have ceased to exist once they died. To be a victim, you need to be alive. And it is just so convenient to forget all that. And it is very hard to really get what goes through the mind of a black woman that has to flee a warzone with her children in her hand, nd the clothes on her back, especially if you are a white older woman that was never even been close to a country where hunger was a problem. But for a man, it is very easy to imagine being dead. Because we want to live. And most of us have experienced, or will experience, being in a situation where we could be forced in the military. because, we are expendable. How can something expendable suffer in war?>Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat.fucking idiotic thing to say...."
97,"[Six richest people from here](http://www.businessinsider.com/50-richest-people-on-earth-2016-1):- Gates, $87.4B- Ortega, $66.8B- Buffet, $60.7B- Bezos, $56.6B- Koch, $47.4B- Other Koch, $46.8BThat's $365.7B in total. 6% of that would be $21B.12.7% of the world's population lives below the lowest poverty line ([$1.90/day](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview)). That's about 900M people. $21B/900M/($1.90 per day) gives about 12 days out of poverty if they were making effectively $0 before the infusion. If they were close to the line, let's say making $1.80, then they would be out of poverty for about eight months (243.8 days). Either way, the quote seems inaccurate or misleading (it's phrased as ""poverty's gone forever!"" instead of ""poverty's gone for a couple of weeks!""). The very wealthiest people aren't sufficiently wealthy when you spread their cash over the huge number of people who make effectively nothing."
98,"That image is as sketchy as it gets, and the data seems to be fake. Looking at the first row (Georgia), CNN's exit poll numbers are 65 Clinton, 34 Bernie, but the [same exit poll on CNN's website](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/ga/Dem) shows almost exactly what the final tally was (71 to 28).As others said, exit polls are also notoriously inaccurate, and ""controversial"" images like those appear every election cycle, fake or not ([see here](http://whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/exit_poll.gif)).Never trust the political content you see on Facebook, especially when it's so badly made.Exit polls aren't reliable for election results. [Nate Silver ended up tweeting a joke about these kinds of conspiracies](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/210185033284190210). If you're looking for why exit polls aren't reliable, [here's a good article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/outraged-wisconsin-exit-polls-so-wrong).>...Leading you to believe that things were rigged on the DNC side.  Plenty of explanations apart from being rigged.  An exit poll is just someone asking people who they voted for and marking it down. Could just be a lot of people lied about voting for Bernie.No. This is someone who just doesn't understand Margin of Error, or is exploiting others lack of understanding.Taking just the first line:  Clinton: 64.8 +/- 5.18 (so anywhere from 72% to 59.6%)    Sanders: 33.8 +/- 5.18 (so anywhere from 39% to 28.6%)    This means the projected lead for Clinton is somewhere between 43.4% and 20.6%. Making her eventual win and lead in vote counts right in line with projections.Numeracy is important.Its harder with more people running or fewer votes.  Check teh big counties :P"
99,"An unattributed quote? That plays into conservative fantasy? No fact checking required: it's crap.Even if some random individual did say this, who cares? A quick glance at Bernie's own statements on veterans proves this to be crap.I would be surprised if it was real, but then again naive teenagers have been known to say incredibly stupid things at times. Either way, it's just garbage propaganda and is best ignored.Edit: It appears to have originated at [Humans Of Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash's](https://www.facebook.com/perpetuallyunemployed/photos/a.625517497597048.1073741826.623647834450681/626244750857656/?type=3&theater) Facebook page.The image was created based on [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/perpetuallyunemployed/photos/a.625517497597048.1073741826.623647834450681/626244750857656/?type=3&theater).  Of course, one Facebook post does not define any of Bernie Sanders' positions.I think the point of the image was to show incredulity towards one Bernie Sanders supporter, not Bernie Sanders himself.Bernie has never stated anything close to what this says. The person that wrote this is most likely pushing a conservative agenda, and this was created to incite conservatives and further harden their stance.

102,"You're asking us to prove a negative, and I don't think anyone has enough time to look up the statutes in all 50 states.As far as I know, the states that protect trans people from bathroom discrimination do so only in schools. California was the first, in 2013, and there are a handful of states that offer some amount of protection to students. Most of these are school policies, not laws.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-law-allows-transgender-students-to-pick-bathrooms-sports-teams-they-identify-with/http://cplaction.com/hs-athletics/By the way, the reason this is important is that transgendered women are often assaulted when they use men's restrooms.Even if they did pass such a law it would be entirely unenforceable. In order to make a criminal case you'd need to overcome 1st amendment protections (I certainly have the right to tell Trans folks what I think, even if the law disagrees with my opinion and the Courts will uphold that) and you'd need to prove criminal intent. Distinguishing between a Trans individual who can't pass as a member of the opposite sex and someone wandering into the wrong rest room is a matter of opinion. So just from a practical standpoint, in the unlikely event that such a law has been passed its going to be impossible to enforce and, in the even more unlikely event that it's enforced, it'll never be upheld. Which leads me to suspect that it's hogwash."
103,"[Here's a chart](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/taxmageddon.png) which shows the total tax rate for various income groups. As you can see, poor and working class people pay considerably less today than they did 50 years ago, middle class people pay about the same, and wealthy people pay much less than they did then.So taxes in general have gone down quite a bit.As for Social Security, there's a big irony at play here. There are a lot of economic snake oil salesmen who say that Social Security is on a path to bankruptcy, and only a major change (usually, privatization and reduced benefits) can save it.In reality, if nothing changes then Social Security will continue to pay full benefits for the next 25-35 years. After that, it will have to pay only 75-80% of benefits. This would probably be offset with some injections of money from the general fund, since Social Security recipients will make up at least 20% of the population (and probably about a third of all voters) by that time.And here's the thing: even if Social Security beneficiaries get only 75% of the promised benefit in 2040, [they'll still be getting more money, after adjusting for inflation, than today's beneficiaries](http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/popups/socsec_straight/content.1.html), thanks to cost-of-living increases that are built into the system.So here's the big irony: the only way that Social Security recipients can lose out is if there is a major reform to the program. In other words, the only real threat to Social Security is the people who are running around saying that the system is going bankrupt.One last thing: we could keep Social Security solvent indefinitely simply by charging Social Security taxes on ALL wages and salaries, instead of taxing wages and salaries up to $118,500. That's right: a modest tax increase that would affect only people with 6 figure incomes would ensure that everyone enjoys the full promised benefit, no privatization or benefit cuts required.Taxes haven't gone up on anybody except for people who make over $200,000. Above $200,000 of income there is an additional 0.9% payroll tax for Medicare and Medicaid as well as an additional 3.8% tax on investment income. For income above $400,000 the top bracket has also increased from 35% to 39.6%. So unless the commenter here is making above $200,000, their taxes have not gone up.What was said in the post was ""I pay more taxes than I've ever paid"". The person doesn't say if they make more money in the last 8 years than they ever have, which is very likely as people get steady raises and promotions over time and wages tend to increase, even if small. Therefore, even if his/her tax rate hasn't changes, or even decreased, its still possible that total taxes paid have gone up to match increases wages.However, the idea stated in the post of free state college being paid from working class taxes is wrong, as the money is raised majorly from an FTT on speculative trading. This is the major point that brought up the amount he/she already pays in taxes.The big reason that the middle class might pay more percent in taxes is that the poor have far less money to spend on luxuries, so less spent in sales tax, and can't afford a home, so pay less in property tax. The rich get tax breaks and therefore pay for less than they used to. Companies pay far less than they used to. The percentage of your wages being taken hasn't gotten worse, but the amount everyone else is paying could be less so you pay a larger slice of the pie. The poor and middle class spend most of their money, and that money is spent on things which are taxes. Gas, alcohol in bars, cigarettes, property tax, lottery tickets, and sales tax are paid on almost all income. The poor have less to spend in dollars, and the rich don't spend all their money. They can take tax free options to save money on investments and defer taxes for later in hopes that the laws are changed to save them money.You would have to get a much more specific answer from the person to check it, because it could be true or false depending how its framed, like a political message. Are we talking effective tax rate, before or after deductions and loopholes? Millionaires pay a lower tax rate than the middle class, but you can't blame liberal democrats for that, because that's Reaganomics. Who counts as middle class, as the true middle class is far smaller than it was in the past. Median HH income is around $54k. Are talking about the middle quintile of total income earners as a dollar amount or as a number of the population?There is one more blame in the post as well: ""thanks to your main man Obama"". You would have to ask what specific changes Obama has made that has caused his/her taxes to increase."
104,"I was watching Kasich and Rubio give their post-primary speeches today and there were pro-Trump hecklers at both.Rubio: Don't worry, we won't beat you up at our rallies.Kasich: I went to college in the 70s so I appreciate a good peaceful protestZero for the Republican supporters is hyperbole.  I'm sure you can find individual instances of Republican supporters disrupting a Democratic event.  Although it would be difficult to determine whether any particular ""Republican supporter"" wasn't actually a Democratic plant.It's clear that thousands of demonstraters disrupted Donald Trump's town hall in Chicago.  Disrupted, meaning the event had to be cancelled to ensure public safety.The image, while not totally truthful, has enough truthiness to be accurate, in my opinion.Every political rally I've ever been to has had protesters. It becomes disruptive when violence is employed.Protesting is a good thing, it's an expression of freedom of speech and in a crowd of thousands of people there *should* be some dissenters. The key thing is the idea that people are ""disrupting"" events, which is a function of use of violence.So ask your friend who is using violence.Trump is a big draw for hecklers, I don't know that there's been a proportionate reaction from the other side. But if one case can prove the whole thing wrong: http://www.politico.com/video/2016/01/bernie-sanders-shuts-down-a-trump-supoorter-at-a-campaign-event-038264Could not find much either.Zero is unlikely to be true, but obviously Trump has been the one to have the most events interupted. He won't get my vote because he is a racist asshole, but in America, he should be allowed to hold campaign events without people shutting them down with protests. It's a little thing called the first Amendment. When he holds a campaign event in a college auditorium,  that is by definition a private event.  You may protest outside, but there is a mountain of legal precedent showing that when you disrupt a private event, you are violating his 1st Amendment rights and not the other way around when they throw you out.I reject the premise.  Protest and disapproval is not the same as intolerance. The way I know is that Republicans told us so when they railed against Obama while dog-whistling racist undertones. ""Opposition is not racism!"", they said. Well...what's good for the goose....Get a clear, precise operational definition of ""disrupt."" I think the picture will change in that process."
105,"Hillary Clinton was certainly the lead on healthcare and dealing with Bill Clinton's accusations of sexual harassment/assault. So those are accurate.Most of the rest are folks Hillary Clinton recommended for appointment - I'm unsure of the accuracy of those.The remaining things seem like a stretch.She also participated in many more policy issues and the president makes hundreds of appointments (though I have no idea how many Hillary Clinton participated in).This seems mostly accurate, but it's picking out a few issues from 8 years of political activity. This is meaningless without some comparison to the ratio of failures/successes of other politicians at similar levels.While the condescending and mocking tone of this heavily indicates a bias by the writer, even a biased writer can make factual claims. However, it is a sign that such claims should be taken with a grain of salt. In regards to the claims the OP is making:> When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform.“Allowed” is a bit of a condescending way to word this, but largely it’s true. Hillary Clinton was assigned by Bill to head the Task Force on National Health Care Reform.> Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress.There is no evidence I can find that there were any “threats” or “intimidation” beyond the usual negotiation that comes with dealing with Congress. What’s more, this is highly misleading about the health reform initiative’s popularity (or lack thereof) with Democratic Congressmen.Just as with the Affordable Care Act, healthcare reform was highly opposed by Republicans and the health insurance industry. Still, despite this, many Democrats agreed with the general brunt of the bill, but disagreed on the details. Multiple Democratic Congressmen responded to Bill Clinton’s bill with versions of their own, but none gained enough traction to be the definitive version of the bill.In the end, this was less an issue about lacking support and more about an inability to gather Democrats around one version of the bill. Hardly Hillary’s fault.> This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other effortsI have difficulty finding the costs of the things noted here, although it bears mention that studies about health care in America have obvious applicability outside of the specific bill that the Clintons were pushing, and as such studies like this are anything but a waste of money, as the original author of this claim seems to assert.> Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.There is no evidence that I can find that Bill Clinton had Hillary select his attorney general. Hillary insisted that Bill appoint a female to the position, but it looks like these choices were Bill’s.> Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Again, not Hillary’s choices. In fact, while a [Newsweek article](http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-first-lady-newsweeks-1993-cover-story-321514) depicts Hillary as a part of the vetting process, this is only after Bill met with her. So you can argue that Hillary made a poor decision giving the thumbs-up, but that still doesn’t make it her choice.Also, it bears mention that these two women were withdrawn from consideration for the position due to the fact that they’d previously hired illegal immigrants, and Kimba Wood had actually done so at a time when it was still legal.> Next she chose Janet RenoAgain, no evidence I can find indicates that Reno was Hillary’s choice. Hillary only pushed for Bill to hire a woman.>  – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.”First of all, “husband bill” is laughably condescending, as if we’ve forgotten how they’re related already. But that aside, this quote comes from Republican strategist (and former Clinton adviser) [Dick Morris](http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Bill-Clinton-Janet-Reno-Waco-hated/2014/04/14/id/565512/). However, there is indication that Morris [may have fabricated](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2010/04/20/did-dick-morris-fabricate-new-clinton-reno-waco/163499) at least some of his claims, so he’s not a very reliable source.Since there’s not really anything tying Janet Reno to Hillary Clinton, I’m going to skip the rest about Reno, since it doesn’t apply to Clinton.> Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection.1. Lani Guinier’s name is misspelled here.2. She was not a nominee for “the head of the Civil Rights Commission”, she was a nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.3. Guanier was a long-time personal friend of *both* Clintons from their days at Yale. To indicate that this was Hillary’s choice is ignoring that shared history.4. As usual, no evidence I can find points to Guanier being Hillary’s choice.> Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations.Again, condescending tone. And now it’s building this tone on a narrative which, as far as any evidence I can find indicates, is a complete fantasy.> She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department,Again a misspelling. His name is Webb Hubbell. And like Guanier, Hubbell was a long-time acquaintance of *both* Clintons, so to place his selection on Hillary’s back is misleading. Also, he was involved in the Clinton administration well before any involvement with the Justice Department.> Vince Foster for the White House staff,Vince Foster suffered from depression and anxiety, and the move to Washington added even more stress. To blame *anyone* for his suicide is rather despicable, and to imply that there might have been some scheme behind it is outrageous.Also, as if it even needs saying, I see no evidence that this was Hillary’s choice. In fact, Foster was a childhood friend of Bill Clinton.> and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Again, mutual friend of both Clintons. Again, no evidence that this was Hillary’s choice.> Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply.Top searches for “Harry Thompson Hillary” bring up copies of the huge diatribe above and not much else. After a lot of searching, I found this is because of yet another misspelling. The person referred to here is Harry Thomason, who first brought the improprieties within the White House Travel Office to the attention of the Clintons.I can’t find any indication that this was done in retaliation for refusal of awarding of contracts.> She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.The funny thing is that “Travelgate” was largely about the firing of employees of the White House Travel Office for financial improprieties uncovered by the FBI. The sort of thing people generally agree should see government officials ejected from their jobs.> Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds.

The Clintons had White House staff [drug tested](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/16/us/white-house-acknowledges-21-had-extra-drug-tests.html), with none testing positive for drug use.So just another claim cooked up by the political opposition.> suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone,Hillary denied hiring him.

That’s just silly.> Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.FBI agents doing this work now work out of an FBI field office in Washington. It’s not like the need to do these background checks disappeared when the office was closed.(Cont...)It's hard to debunk all of these things, because each claim would take about 15 to 20 minutes of investigation to fully understand. With 17 points, that's about 6 hours of research. There are elements of truth in all of these, but they're skewed soundbites more than anything else. You're right to look at this with some suspicion.I've written about the Clintons ""stealing furniture"" before. [Politifact debunked this one,](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/01/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-accuses-clinton-stealing/) but I'll go ahead and paraphrase it. When the Clintons left the White House, they did take some items that were deemed gifts. But the gift giving process is governed by seven different agencies, so stuff gets pretty confusing. Some things were given to Hillary between leaving the White House and joining the Senate as well, so which rules do you apply to that scenario? Some agencies did request the return of some things. But I think there are two important things to note here though: 1. Some gifts were eventually given back to the Clintons, even after the Clintons returned them. 2. The same thing happened to the Reagan family—they left the White House with stuff they shouldn’t have, and they returned them later. With the evidence, it looks less like a blatant disregard of the law and more like an honest mistake.At the end of the day, you can believe what you want. But there's much more evidence of the other side than a one sentence soundbite implies. I think applies to most of the Clinton scandals.""All I Know Is What's On The Internet"" ~ Donald trump>Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress.

106,"[Worker productivity has indeed been rising for at least the last half-century](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/assets_c/2010/03/productivity%2010-03%20-%201-thumb-570x377-22594.png). I suppose one could argue that the lack of productivity of youths is made up for by the extra increased productivity of other age groups, but I think this would be difficult to measure, and as far as I can tell it isn't supported by any studies I can find.Really, this seems like a case of some belief that ""newer generations are lazy"" and ""older generations have a better work ethic"". When polled, people [strongly believe this to be true](http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-01-16/mill2.jpg). However, I can find nothing that objectively demonstrates that this is anything more than a stereotype.Add on to this the fact that the challenges faced by newer generations are much different than those faced by older generations at this age - [college tuition and home prices have gone up](http://www.clothiersprings.com/images/graphs/college_inflation.jpg) while [the average wage has stagnated](http://www.motherjones.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-08%20at%2011.36.19%20AM.png).So when newer generations complain about the cost of going to college or the small size of a paycheck, older generations might not understand that they had it much better than today's younger generations do, and get the impression that youths are just too lazy to put in the work for the money, not realizing that that same paycheck doesn't go nearly as far these days, and getting a good job means getting a much more expensive education.Given the lack of information supporting this claim, it seems unfounded, and while there doesn't appear to be any *clear* evidence to disprove it, I would say that all indicators show that this is a generational misconception rather than a reality-based assessment.**Edit**: Okay, this has been up for two weeks and mine is still the only comment. Given that evidence indicates that our nation *as a whole* has increased in productivity, and lacking any evidence that this increase does *not* include young people, I'm going to have to say this claim is **False** unless I see any solid data to the contrary."
107,"Interesting.  I'm no fan of Obama's foreign policy, but the Iraq War alone resulted in [more than 600,000 violent deaths.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties)  Even if you were to pin full blame for the Syrian Civil War on Obama, he still wouldn't be close to that number.I can't find any source that blames Obama for the deaths of more servicemen than Bush. I have seen plenty of reports that Obama has ordered several magnitudes more drone strikes than Bush (ten times?). Although that is likely due to the timing of the technology.It's hard to fact check without knowing what Jillette is actually referring too. If he doesn't mean anything specific, it's a meaningless statement that can't be fact checked. He *could* be referring to drone strikes, which are the most direct from Obama thing the US is doing that's killing people. The drone program *has* expanded under Obama, but I don't know numbers for people killed under the program during Bush and during Obama.Source and context?My assumption (if I had to make one) is that Penn is referring to escalating drone strikes:https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/01/23/more-than-2400-dead-as-obamas-drone-campaign-marks-five-years/I think he's referring to drone strikes and targeted killing. *shrug*This seems to be the source interview :http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2010/06/penn-jillette-is-willing-to-be-a-guest-on-adolf-hitlers-talk-showA lot of conjecture about Syria etc but the date of the interview was 2010It's almost like Obama is acting on information that an entertainer and magician wouldn't be privy to.Post should be deleted.

109,"[Here](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-economy-or-terrorism-which-issue-most-important-voters) is a fairly recent MSNBC poll. It shows that Democratic voters' top concern is the economy, while Republicans' top concern is terrorism. Republicans place the economy second, but for Democrats, terrorism ranks far lower - health care, education, and the environment all rank higher.But ""foreign policy"" is also listed in this poll, and that ranked very low for *both* parties (although slightly lower for Democrats).So I think there is *some* truth in saying that Democrats don't consider foreign policy an especially high priority. However, I think it would be stretching things to say that they don't care about it *at all*. It's just a lower priority to them than other issues facing our country.**Edit**: Given that there haven't been any new offerings in over a week, I'm just going to leave this up a few days more. Unless someone can persuade me otherwise, I think the best fit for this claim is **Partisan Bias** - Polls do seem to show that Democrats consider foreign policy to be a *lower priority* than other issues, like the economy, but that is not the same as saying they don't care about it at all. In addition, with the exception of terrorism, Republicans *also* do not list foreign policy as a very high priority. As the wording of this seems to imply that Democrats don't care about foreign policy at all, and that they are somehow different than Republicans in this, this already weak and unsubstantiated conclusion becomes a pale shadow of anything that one could consider credible.**Edit**: No one seems to have disputed this, so I'm making it official: This is **Partisan Bias**, with **Mostly False** and **False** being close contenders as well.I don't see that being the case as the two running for POTUS are a former Secretary of state and a guy who uses political ideas of other nations like universal healthcare for his run. Though I don't have any articles at this time"
110,"For a Truthfulness score you dont need to count 'true' statements.I think the reverse is much more valid an untruthfulness meter.Also the data is so random it doesnt really show anything.This would be made more interesting if each row contained the total number of samples for each candidate as well as the percentage, and some confidence intervals.  And if it were sorted by a better metric than just the sample mean.For the reasons you stated, there isn't really a good way to judge the frequency of someone's truthfulness (or conversely, their untruthfulness), especially using only those statements selected by Politifact. No one is judging every statement, every press release... and even if they did, some things are more open to interpretation than others.It's interesting to see how the numbers here stack up, but it doesn't really prove anything other than, for example, that Politifact is more likely to select for review a Hillary Clinton quote it deems ""true"" than it is to select a Donald Trump quote it deems true. Is this because Donald Trump lies more? Is it because Clinton is more careful with the wording of her statements? Is it because Trump's quotes are often more newsworthy? Is it because Politifact is more interested in reviewing false Trump quotes? Or is it because Politifact is more *likely* to decide that a statement from Trump is a lie than a statement from Clinton is?Most of these are really a matter of opinion - I know, for example, that there are those who feel that Politifact is biased in one way or another, although establishing a bias without a clear intent or tie to involved parties is difficult. It bears mention that they themselves have answered one of these questions: in their recent Reddit AMA, they [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/439cg5/iama_the_editors_of_politifact_who_were_up_too/czgjdj0?context=3) that they've rated Obama's statements more frequently than any other source, and of the candidates for president in 2016, Hillary Clinton's statements were rated more than any other candidate.But again, none of this is conclusive. It doesn't prove or disprove anyone's truthfulness, nor does it prove or disprove whether Politifact does in some way have a bias.This is why it's probably best to encourage a look at claims on an individual basis, judging by the facts behind them, and the arguments for and against those specific claims.Not that I'm saying that the OP here is necessarily implying anything. Just pointing this out.This is interesting to me in this way: Even if you are at the top (Kasich) I don't think you're wanting to cite this example to your potential voters:""I'm truthful 58.25% of the time folks!  And, that's actually the best!"""
111,"None that I have seen which can be seen 1 of 2 ways. EitherA) The results of a poll were bad and they were scrappedB) There is not enough public interest to even have the poll.TBH most US citizens would have no idea who he is or why he matters. They leave the logistics of war up to the military, who is killed / left behind makes no difference unless fox news decides otherwise with them sparking their base.I cannot find any official polls. My unofficial opinion is that the U.S. public support for deposing Assad through military force is very low. Deposing him by supporting the rebels is a more popular idea, but that idea's support is slipping. With the Russians throwing their full force of weight behind Assad it will be virtually impossible to get rid of him without some sort of political solution.I think there was some decent level of support for a non fly zone and/or air support for the actual moderate FSA rebels in 2011 and 2012 when the massive protests against the Baathists and Assad in Syria where in the news. Now however with the rise of al-Nusra and especially ISIS most people in the US unfortunately have a neutral or even positive view of Assad staying in power indefinitely.I don't care either way.  The shit stain called the middle east is not my problem. I care more about our military and monetary support of Israel and their continued land theft and murdering of the people who live there.  But I am in the minority I think."
112,"This seems a clunky, roundabout way of confirming what Sanders has already said repeatedly, [that he supports Medicare For All](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-healthcare/#universal-health-care). He's even [authored a bill](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/american-health-security-act-of-2013?inline=file) to that effect.The part that's problematic is ""[...] into a national system and turn it over to the states to administer"", and it's problematic because that's essentially what we already do. Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are all federally-mandated programs that are all mostly state-administered, so this part of things wouldn't really change. It wouldn't be ""turning into"" anything different as far as this part of it goes.As such, I'd be tempted to label this as **Partisan Bias** if it weren't for the fact that the source of the comment is from the same party as the person being commented *on*. As such, I suppose **Mostly True** is the closest label we have.**Edit**: Okay, I'm marking this as **Mostly True**, although its very nearly misleading enough that it could be **Half-True** or **Partisan Bias**. I dunno, it's a judgment call, really. But at the very least, my reasoning for this can be read here if anyone takes issue with it.The truth of the statement aside, I am not immediately struck as to why doing that would be a bad thing. We already do that in a way, but with more administrative overhead, don't we? Can someone enlighten me?Yeah single payer healthcare. Medicare for All. Not exactly controversial among anyone who knows about healthcare or bad whatsoever.This is mostly false since it ignores a very basic component of Sanders' plan which to cover ***all*** of those programs by instituting Medicare for all. Additionally, Sanders' plan also calls doesn't require Republican Governors' agreement to enroll the state. This is another falsehood.I'm interested to see if it's true. We're studying Social Policy in class, and I wonder if that's the case..."
113,"I don't see how Reddit can fact check this.

114,"More so that the second looks like he is saying that the country should make its own guns, not that each individual should.Reaffirming that the 2nd amendment is literally talking about military service. Not bringing handguns into Walmart.Nice~  Thanks op!!The quote in question comes from George Washington's first State of the Union address, which can be read in full [here](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29431). The pertinent part, in context, reads as such:> Among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of providing for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.> **A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.**> The proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable will be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may be made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy.So the first quote you cite is incorrect, and the second one is correct.It is very clear, given the context of this paragraph, that Washington is speaking here of military matters, and specifically the need for America, as a country, to arm and supply itself, rather than its individuals. Whatever Washington's views on individual ownership of guns are, they are not represented in this quote.I'm afraid, though, that the way you've worded this submission makes it difficult to flair as ""True"" or ""False"", as you have included both the false quote *and* the true one in your header. As such, I may have to leave it unmarked, but I believe that in any case, you have your answer.It seems to me that this is almost a rewriting of the Second Amendment. ""Armed and disciplined"" = ""Well regulated militia"", ""safety and interest"" = ""security of a free state"" and ""render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies"" = ""to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed""."

116,"The Great Society was really an extension of a tremendous anti-poverty push that began during Kennedy's term. Under Kennedy, unemployment insurance was broadened considerably, Social Security was expanded, the minimum wage was extended to cover more workers, and a massive investment in low income housing was undertaken. To this, Johnson added Medicaid, Job Corps, VISTA, Head Start, and, most importantly, Medicare.[The poverty rate in 1959 was around 23%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Poverty_Rate_1959_to_2011._United_States..PNG). Johnson and Kennedy's programs helped cut this rate in half by 1968. Since 1968, the poverty rate has fluctuated roughly in tandem with the unemployment rate, but has trended upward as we've become stingier with benefits.So the Great Society has definitely had a big impact on poverty. Just imagine, for example, what the poverty rate would be like among the elderly if Medicare had not been implemented and if Social Security had not been expanded.But you seem to be saying that reductions in the poverty rate aren't real or worthwhile unless we see a reduction in pre-welfare poverty (what the poverty rate would be if there were no government assistance). While the pre-welfare poverty rate is now about the same as it was before the 1960s, I would argue that it would be a lot higher if it weren't for the Great Society.First, there's the fact that [poverty itself negatively impacts economic growth](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/EXTLACOFFICEOFCE/0,,contentMDK:20819439~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:870893,00.html):>This is because the poor, who generally lack access to credit and insurance, are in no position to undertake many of the profitable activities that fuel investment and growth — creating a vicious circle in which low growth results in high poverty and high poverty in turn results in low growth.>Poor regions lacking infrastructure, for instance, fail to attract investment. Poor families, faced with substandard schools and high opportunity costs, under-invest in the education of their children. Poor countries, unable to moderate income disparities, find social tensions exacerbated that, in turn, make it difficult for a healthy business climate to flourish.>""In order to move from a vicious to a virtuous circle, we need to launch a broad-based attack on poverty that feeds back into higher growth that in turn reduces poverty,"" said Guillermo Perry, World Bank Chief Economist for Latin America and the Caribbean. ""Fighting poverty is not only good for the poor; it's also good business for the whole of society.""So without the poverty reduction brought about by the Great Society, we probably would have seen considerably less economic growth over the past half century. This slower growth would have been exasperated by greater economic instability, because programs like unemployment insurance and TANF have a cushioning effect during economic downturns. These programs compel the federal government to inject more money into the economy when joblessness increases, which helps 'prime the economic pump' by allowing consumers to continue to buy necessary goods, which in turn allow businesses to retain more workers than they could otherwise. Without these programs, for example, it's likely that we would have slid into a depression during the most recent economic crisis.So the answer to your main question is yes, these programs did a lot of good. They have lifted millions of Americans out of poverty over the past half century, and continue to do so. In addition, they encourage economic growth by encouraging profitable activities, by encouraging investment in poor areas, and by bringing stability to the economy."

Given the extreme variance in numbers I'd say the definition of ""mass shooting"" may have been defined by the producer of that graph so as to produce the desired vitriolic result. The common definition emerging is ""4 or more murders by an agent/group of related agents with no cooling off period"" but there are some groups trying to leverage the lack of a formal definition for their own ends -- especially given there is the general understanding of what the phrase implies.I digress, however.

Until they discern between public / unmotivated mass shootings and robberies, it's just a gun death toll.

For a thorough refutation of the figures, you'd have to find the original report (and ideally the most recent published version) to understand how those numbers were collected, what they include, and if they're accurate. I'd also point out that since whites are 63.7% of the population, and blacks are 12.5% of the population, if violence were to occur *at random*, it would occur 5x more frequently on whites. The author then double charges on this by multiplying by the population again.In the case of homicide (just one kind of violent crime), the facts do not support that violent crime is radically one-directional (ie 25x more black to white, as the chart suggests). In reality, ~82% of homicides against whites are committed by whites, ~15% by blacks, ~1% other, and ~2% unknown. For comparison, ~90% of homicides against blacks are committed by blacks, ~7.5% whites, 1% other, 1.5% unknown.It is worth noting that blacks do commit proportionally more violent crimes in the United States than whites (ie violent crimes per capita), but when socioeconomic status is accounted for, the difference between the races disappears. Violent crime is a result of living poor in America, and more black people are living poor in America; ergo black people commit more violent crimes per capita. If anyone has links to the original reports on violence, I'd be happy to take a look at more facts.According to the graphic, that data comes from the [2010 National Crime Victimization Survey](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv10.pdf). If you look through that survey, **there is no data on interracial crime**. It lists the number of crimes where the perpetrator was black, white, hispanic, pacific islander, etc. It also lists the number of crimes where the victim was black, white, hispanic, pacific islander, etc. It **does not** list crimes committed by white perpetrators against black victims or black perpetrators against white victims.So either this graphic is totally invented, or the data comes from a different  source (probably a less reputable one, or they'd have cited their actual source).Edit: Or, they did what /u/justforsaving discusses (to debunk the claim), and just took the number of crimes committed by black/white perpetrators, compared it to the number of crimes against black/white victims with no consideration of how many of those crimes were actually inter-/intra-racial, and of course got a 5:1, and then 25:1, ratio simply because of differences in population size.Edit 2: This may fall under editorializing, because I am speculating about the underlying purpose of the graphic, but: The graphic seems to be suggesting that black perpetrators target white victims, while black individuals are rarely targeted by white perpetrators. The [FBI's statistics on hate crimes](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/topic-pages/victims_final) from 2014 speaks to the issue of hate crimes (there's a difference between bias-motivated crimes and hate crimes, but they're similar enough for this purpose). As /u/justforsaving said, if these crimes were randomly distributed, you'd expect 5 times as many crimes against white victims as against black victims. In 2014, the FBI reports 3,227 crimes motivated by racial bias. of these 62.7% were motivated by anti-black bias, and 22.7% were motivated by anti-white bias. So rather than the 5:1 ratio based on a random distribution, there's almost a 1:3 ratio.Edit 3: I'm wrong about randomly distributed hate crimes, if we assume that white perpetrators don't commit anti-white biased crimes and the same for black perpetrators. Instead, I should have compared the 36.3% of the population that's non-white to the 87.5% of the population that's not black. So based on that *extremely* rough estimate, random distribution would be 1 anti-white crime to 2.4 anti-black crimes, or fairly close to the 1:2.76 ratio that exists. Still this is evidence against an epidemic of anti-white hate crimes, which are slightly less frequent than what you'd exist.And when adjusted for economic factors the difference virtually disappears. Now where did I see that data?"
124,"This is easily debunked simply by quoting the **first sentence** in the article. But then this is Newmax, what else would you expect.> U.S. military pilots who have returned home from the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq have definitively stated they were unable to obtain clearance to launch strikes and in turn were blocked from dropping 75 percent of their weaponry on terror targetsSeems good to me. We shouldn't allow for the indiscriminate bombing of civilians. So if the pilots cannot be sure of their target or sure they can minimize civilian deaths or collateral damage they shouldn't drop their bombs.What nonsense. Indiscriminate bombing is the perfect recruitment tool for ISIS, the military brass and political leadership clearly understand this and respond accordingly."
125,"At one point in the video it says that whites are now a minority in London. This is not even remotely true. Whites are 75% of the demographic majority in London. I just did a quick google search for this fact. This being so patently false, I realize the makers of this can't be trusted. (Not that I thought they could before). If they are going to lie about this easily checked fact, they have no interest in telling the truth, just in pushing their agenda. Not saying that everything they say is false, but we can clearly be skeptical.Here's some background from Snopes. It's 8chan propaganda. And screw having to source all this supercut garbage. Why are we letting bigots force us to source their propaganda? Especially considering the suspicious editing and use of subtitles that could literally say anything. Let them provide sources or be dismissed out of hand.http://www.snopes.com/2015/11/17/disturbing-muslim-refugee-video/People have sent this to me saying ""every story has two sides"". I'd love to reply with facts.This video is mostly about how they're destroying Germany.  I guess someone from Germany could step in and let us know if life is really like this what this video portrays.I'd like to see what is found out about this vid, as well.I would say that this is an issue that affects American politics as you said, so it seems relevant enough as far as I'm concerned.That said, your attempt to get users here to pick apart 20 minutes of video seems like it may be overly optimistic. You can certainly edit your OP with whatever other users here dig up, but I don't think you're going to get the entire video dissected.From the spot checking I've done, the claims are true.Rapes are way up in Sweden. Muhammed is in fact the most popular baby boys name in London, etc.I really hope this video can be broken down and fact checked in depth as you request.I want to know more about the makers of this garbage."
126,"The article you link to seems to supply evidence both for and against this claim, but seems to selectively read it to favor the positive, and apparently stretch the positive to say more than it really does.In the ""for"" category, the first chart seems to show that when black fathers are involved in their children's lives, they are *more* involved.However, in the second chart farther down, it seems to indicate that blacks have an *extremely* disproportionate percentage of single-parent families, implying that it's more likely for one parent to not be in the picture at all. The person writing the article seems to hand-wave this away as being caused by both parents being present but unmarried, but in the third graph, it shows that (regardless of marital status), a whopping 50.4% of black children living only with their mother, as opposed to 25.7% for Hispanics and 18.5% for whites. The writer points out that the percentage of black single fathers is higher than that of other races, but this is such a miniscule statistic (4.3%) that it barely seems deserving of mention.In other words, these statistics seem to indicate that, no, single-parent families are not the result of low marriage numbers, at least not primarily. The missing black fathers are at least largely due to something else.I would argue that these statistics show the opposite of what the article claims in its header: that black fathers are indeed more absent in the lives of their children than parents of other ethnicities. But on the bright side, as I said at the start, those who are present are *more* present.I'll leave this open for debate, on the off-chance that I missed something or misread the statistics, but absent that I'd lean in favor of **Mostly False**.Edit: Corrected a word.Edit: As swefpelego kindly indicated, I may be a bit too hasty in coming to a conclusion here, and I'm going to give this thread time to breathe before giving it flair. I strongly encourage other users here to post any relevant information on the topic and I'll leave it up for this purpose for a while.You should add the proviso ""in similar living situations"", as that is what the CDC data show and the reproduced chart uses that language.  The DK author later on confirms later down, that you cannot draw a conclusion either way from the data presented on an overall rate."
127,"As the title in the OP indicates, this article (image) makes six ""points"", and consists of arguably seven or eight claims. It is as follows:> 1. America is ""*capitalist and greedy*""... yet half of the population is subsidized.> 2. Half of the population is subsidized... yet think they are ""victims"".> 3. They think they're ""*victims*""... yet their representatives run the government.> 4. Their representatives run the government... yet the poor get poorer.> 5. The poor get poorer... yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about.> 6. They have things that people in other countries only dream about... yet they want America to be more like those other countries.The problem with many of these claims is that they are not factual in nature, and tend towards being more rhetorical than anything. However, of what we can judge on a factual basis, it doesn't bode well:> 1. America is ""*capitalist and greedy*""...""Greedy"" is a subjective term, and can't be confirmed or denied. On its own, this claim is **Unverifiable**. ""Capitalist"" is generally defined as an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are privately owned and operated based on the profit motive. With some minor caveats, this is fairly obviously entirely **True**.> yet half of the population is subsidized.Politifact [addressed this claim](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-almost-half-americans-receive-f/). They concluded that the claim was **Mostly True**, because the numbers are correct, although it lumps in everyone under one household, even if not everyone in a household receives subsidies.> yet think they are ""victims"".This claim comes from Mitt Romney's infamous ""47%"" comment. There is no factual basis for this comment, no poll or study that I know of that shows this. As such it is either **False** or **Partisan Bias**.> yet their representatives run the government.That is a broad and oversimplified way to look at government. Currently, our federal government is split, with Republicans controlling the majority of the House, Senate, and arguably Judiciary (depending on how you view the Judiciary), and Democrats in control of the White House. If you extend your view to state and local governments, this becomes even more complex. And even back when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, that control was not absolute. In short, no matter which way you slice it, no party ""controls the government"". **False**.> yet the poor get poorer.This is kind of a vague statement, and there are numerous ways to measure it. Politifact fact-checked a [claim on the poverty rate being higher](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/may/07/jeb-bush/poverty-rate-higher-now-1970s/), which it rates as **Mostly True**. Without having a timeframe and a specific measure to compare, it's hard to answer this statement conclusively, but generally speaking it tends to be more true than not, so Politifact's rating seems fitting.> yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about.That's an even fuzzier statement. Which countries? Which ""things""? If you're making a broad statement like that, you could apply it to virtually anything, in which case, yes, we do have ""things"" that ""other countries"" can only dream about. No other country has the Golden Gate Bridge or Yellowstone or Chris Pratt... but that's not really relevant to anything, is it? Without specifically outlining what it is that is meant, this claim is so poorly-written as to be pointless. I wouldn't even bother giving it a rating.> yet they want America to be more like those other countries.And here we get to an apples and oranges comparison. Because the ""things"" that America has that other countries dream about are not necessarily related to the ways that ""they"" want them to be like other countries.For example, health care, the topic that's been one of the most discussed in America in the last decade. Many on the left in America want America to adopt a single-payer system, like in many Nordic countries. Would people in those countries want the health care system America has? Virtually any time such a question gets asked in one of those countries, it is laughed off as ridiculous.Without specifically outlying what ""things"" means and in which ways this article says ""they"" want America to be ""more like"" ""those other countries"" (non-specific claim after non-specific claim here, you'll notice), it's difficult to come to a complete conclusion on this.However, as this list seems poorly-constructed, fueled by rhetoric rather than facts, and seems to jump to conclusions using apples and orange logic, its main claim, that these points ""will crush Bernie and Hillary supporters"" seems destined to be rated **False**, **Partisan Bias**, or if I'm feeling very, very generous, **Unverifiable**.I'll give others a chance to argue to the contrary, but given the absurdly vague nature of the claims being made here, I strain to see how anyone could paint this as a credible argument.**Edit**: Changed a term to be more accurate.The infographic at the top isn't even making factual claims - there's almost nothing to fact check. /u/drforpretend deals with the couple factual claims it makes.The story underneath it, quoted from [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddavenport/2015/11/01/bernie-and-hillary-beware-something-is-rotting-in-denmark/), seems accurate but misleading. [Cars](http://www.copenhagenize.com/2012/10/danish-180-tax-on-cars-is-rather.html), [gasoline](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/denmark/pump-price-for-gasoline-us-dollar-per-liter-wb-data.html), and [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing) are significantly more expensive in Denmark than the US. And [Denmark has a budget deficit](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/25/uk-denmark-budget-idUKKBN0GP1TT20140825). However, 1. That budget deficit is about [half the US deficit](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-budget-deficit-totaled-424-billion-for-year-ended-august-1441994401) and far lower than most of the EU, and the link for car cost points out that income in Denmark is much higher, mitigating the effect of those costs. So the data is accurate, but it's represented in a very misleading way. 2. As the Forbes article points out, the US and Denmark aren't comparable. So really none of the claims are meaningful.This post made me wonder - is this kinda trolly for this sub or is this exactly what this sub is for? As soon as you see the image, you can tell its a biased piece of click-bait bordering on party propaganda. It's meant to be shared among people who already believe it. The 'facts' are all vague, generalizing strawmen that somehow still manage to be mostly wrong. At the same time, we all have relatives who share this stuff, and some people get sucked in to wanting to refute BS. Is this where we crowdsource the reply? New to the sub so honestly wondering. Edit: plus we're running up to an election in America so ... might be good to clarify for newbies?They are probably referring to this: http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/census-49-americans-get-gov-t-benefits-82m-households-medicaidSo, yes, half of the country gets subsidies. Yes we have some things that people who are impoverished in other countries only dream about. However, there still are countries that have quite a bit more. Most developed nations (and I think developed vs. underdeveloped nations is key to understanding this) have free healthcare and maternity leave. As to running the nation, look at what has happened with the Republican led Congress over the last few years. They blocked most of what was attempted, ~~and seriously gutted the Affordable Care Act~~ (as I mentioned in a lower comment, this is probably false. I looked at amendments and the one that stands out was the attempt to remove the Community Health Option). We can also look at the way income has increased disproportionally for different income brackets.> obviously a biased websiteI think you have your answer right there."

131,"No, you didn't fail to haggle. There are lots of STD tests and each have different costs.

Some, like in Minnesota, offer free or low-cost testing. This is because they are partnering with the local government which subsidizes the tests.Of course, lately, lots of these offices have had their funding slashed/cut because of the bogus video. No doubt this has probably made PP increase its lab test fees.One other problem with this ""meme"" is that under the Affordable Care Act, HIV testing must be provided free of charge and is included in a ""preventative care"" visit. This means no co-pay, either.A complete screen for all STDs, however, is more than the cost of just an HIV test. This ""meme"" doesn't really differentiate between one test and many tests. The ACA does not consider testing for other STDs to be part of the ""preventative care"" exception.I also kind of wonder if the PP here in NYC didn't give you a complete battery of tests. $100 is high, but not for a thorough STD screen.I would have to imagine it cost less than $100 in NYC. I just do to CityMD every months for a basic test and its around that amount. And that's a local for profit clinic. So if you are getting charged that at PP I recommend CityMD anywhere in NYC. It's clean and quick and all that good stuff.i got an HIV test at PP for free IIRCI've never paid for a std test in any country.  Got them free at my university in the USA even.  If it costs $400 outside of school that's messed up.  $20 is high as well but I've had to pay a couple bucks to see a doctor in other countries so I'd be willing to let the $20 slide as an incredibly high copay.Honestly shit like this disgusts me  since you'd think these high prices are trying to encourage the spread of disease."

However, Sanders was referring to 2009-2013, and he only said 99%, as opposed to 100%. On the other hand, his quote was referring to the Top 1%. Additionally, it was only rated ""Mostly True"" because it required qualifiers, such as the fact that it referenced only pre-tax income. However, this does give you a ballpark idea that Warren's claim is likely in the ballpark of the truth, especially since her claim expanded it to include the top 10%.It bears mention that Warren has made another similar claim, that the bottom 90% made more money 30 years ago, which has been [rated by Politifact as Mostly True](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/13/elizabeth-warren/warren-average-family-bottom-90-percent-made-more-/), again ""Mostly True"" because it requires a few qualifiers.It seems likely, then, that this similar claim is most likely *also* ""mostly true"".**Edit**: Okay, a lot of people in this thread seem to be focusing on the question of *why* this might be happening, but the question at hand is whether or not this *is* happening.

135,"The Reagan one is a reference to the Beirut Barracks Bombing on October 23, 1983. It was the result of a suicide bomber attacking a four-story building, which collapsed and crushed those inside. A fact-finding commission later appointed by Reagan found senior military officials responsible for security lapses that allowed the attack to succeed. If the president is responsible for those who serve under him, then this was technically Reagan's fault, but most would probably say it's more accurate to conclude that the blame lies with the senior military officials, since it's doubtful that Reagan was directly involved in the decisions that led to this tragedy.The Bush one is presumably in reference to the Iraq War, which depending on who you ask was either the president's justified response to the information we had at the time, a result of acting on poor intelligence, or intentionally misleading our nation into a war he wasn't fully prepared to fight. Personally, I feel there is plenty enough evidence to point to the latter, but because there are many factors involved here and it is still a contentious topic, I'd say that as far as the facts are concerned, this one's still kinda' up in the air.The Obama one is undoubtedly referring to the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, and as it happens Politifact [addressed this claim](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/13/ronan-farrow/ronan-farrow-says-inadequate-security-funding-cong/). Their diagnosis was that the ""cuts"" in question weren't cuts at all, but rather, a smaller increase in the budget than Obama had requested. And in addition to that, they said that funding had very little to do with the Benghazi attacks - in part, because Benghazi was a temporary facility, it didn't qualify for the full security upgrades in the first place. Technically, that's the State Department's responsibility, but they can hardly be faulted for not spending more money on a temporary facility, and this seems to be at least in part one of those ""hindsight is 20/20"" sort of situations.In short, I think it's really stretching things to blame the deaths during Reagan's term on Reagan, and it seems like it's stretching things to blame Congress *or* the Obama Administration for Benghazi - as far as I can tell, it was unfortunately place of relative low importance that was underfunded as a result of its lacking importance, and not due to some greater negligence by any specific party. As for the Iraq war, one could make that argument, but there is some dispute over the events that could raise the question of whether the deaths in Iraq are due to ""stupid, avoidable mistakes"" - I would argue that the truth is far worse than a ""mistake"", but my argument would be an opinion, not fact.As such, I am inclined to label this as **Mostly False**, **False**, or **Partisan Bias**, but I'm happy to leave this open to debate for a while.**Edit**: Oh, one more thing. ""Stupid"" is a matter of opinion, and ""avoidable"" is usually debatable. Those are words that don't really belong in a fact-check.**Edit 2**: As promised, I'm marking this **Mostly False**The Marines under Reagan is the [bombing of a barracks in Beirut in 1983 by radical Iranians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing) - if it was preventable, I'm not certain, but it certainly happened on Reagan's watch.The 4,500 troops (I'm not certain if this is the final tally or a rounding up or down) is predicated on [faulty intelligence stating that Iraq had or was close to achieving an arsenal of WMD'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Report_on_Pre-war_Intelligence_on_Iraq)s capable of reaching US soil. Some have claimed that right after 9/11 certain members of the Bush cabinet sought to 'find a connection' from 9/11 to Iraq, giving them an excuse to invade. After members of the intelligence community found no evidence of WMD's, they were discredited and in the case of [Valerie Plame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Plame#.22Plamegate.22), identities revealed (during a time of war, no less) Some will argue that the invasion removed a despotic leader, others will say that although a tyrant, Saddam did keep the warring factions in check and that sanctions against Iraq pretty much kept them from pursuing WMDs. Preventable? Probably - but some will argue that Saddam needed removal, while others will argue that there are dozens of despotic rulers who also need removing.[The Benghazi bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack) (like the link below suggests) was partially due to budgetary cuts but also a failure of intelligence to anticipate retaliation from Islamic outrage due to offending YouTube videos insulting Muslims and the Anniversary of 9/11. After more investigations than the one to determine the fault of 9/11,  Former Sec'y Clinton has been cleared of any wrongdoing - whether or not the fault can be placed on budgetary cuts is up for debate.All of these have multiple causes and effects. On the surface, yes, blame can be placed at the feet of those charged.

There is absolutely no way to say this would(n't) have happened given changes XYZ.The best you can do is say, we know these long term trends will make extreme events more common.EDIT: This by no means confirms or discredits the rest of the frames. I'm just nitpcking.EDIT 2: Since I like sauce, here is the sauce for the comic: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241 (paywall)TL;DR: The narrative is mostly true. The causal claims are unverifiable. The only definitely false claim is that unrest in Syria was unexpected.I'll try to go through the factual claims one at a time:Global warming caused an unprecedented drought. The two other comments speak to this. There is some circumstantial evidence supporting the claim, but it's impossible to prove one way or another.A huge drought caused unrest. True. [Source](http://climateandsecurity.org/2014/03/26/review-two-new-studies-on-syria-drought-climate-change-natural-resource-management-and-the-uprising/).Assad practiced a spoils system which intensified political unrest. This is probably true. As /u/qinosen pointed out, it's impossible to distinguish the causal factors without a lot more study, but Assad did have spoil system and his regime had many corrupt practices. The Assad regime also diverted water to large industrial applications and away from the population (like what's happened recently in California and elsewhere in the US). [Source](http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=55376).Assad imprisoned political dissidents, including teens spraying graffiti. True. [Source](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-05-03/structure-syrias-repression). This source describes it *exactly* the way it's described in the comic, which makes me question it a little - if it were the secret police arresting political dissidents, the details shouldn't be so clear and well-known/well-established. However, Assad's regime was certainly oppressive and corrupt, so I trust the general narrative.Torture of those graffiti artists caused the unrest. Again, this is impossible to prove, but the last source I linked supports the claim.Alex Stonehill said uprising was unexpected. I can't find anything by Stonehill supporting this, but I didn't look hard.Security experts claimed Syria was ""immune"" to the Arab Spring. False. The quotation is real (from [this article](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2045328_2045333_2046288,00.html)), but the title of that article is ""Why the Arab Democracy Wave is Unlikely to Reach Syria — Yet."" That is, the Arab Spring will reach Syria, it will just take a little longer. The claim of that article isn't even about the Arab Spring in general. It's that Assad is able to crack down on protest more than Egypt or Tunisia was, so protests wouldn't threaten his regime as it did the regimes of those countries. This has proven true; Bashar al-Assad is still president of Syria ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad)).Syrian agriculture will be fucked in a few decades. This is probably true, as illustrated in a couple of the sources above.ok, well muddying the waters by linking climate change with the war in Syria is questionable at best.  Yes there is drought in many parts of the world (see /u/Arjes source for the science) and yes perhaps it played a part (as well as many other factors) in the unrest that sparked the civil war.  The Origins (real and reported) are going to take years to sort out once the conflict settles down, and researchers who make conflict their business are even daunted by Syria ""...coding of intense violence is known tobe fraught with difficulties and problems. However, what sets this apart from many other cases isprobably the interplay of the difficulties with reporting and capturing reliable information, togetherwith the scale of the violence being perpetrated. "" [Source](http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/info/Complexities%20of%20coding%20Syria.pdf)These researchers have gotten reasonably reliable data out of some of the darkest corners of the world, pretty sure a comic isn't going to get the details right. (or maybe it did, still too early to know)"
139,"Well, apart from the obvious geographic error (Finland isn't a part of Scandinavia), off the top of my head:> 2. Scandinavia isn’t actually as prosperous as liberals like to claim [insert GDP per capita measurements and a link to a source of data from 2004].A better measure is PPP (purchasing power parity) GDP per capita: this accounts for the differing cost of living between countries.  Making a nominal 5% more isn't a great deal if your expenses are 10% higher as a result.[Here's the CIA PPP GDP per capita](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html) - chained dollars have [inflated by 9.44% from 2009 to 2014](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/SUUR0000SA0) so you have to divide those CIA 2014 estimates by 1.0944 in order to compare them to the chained 2009 dollars [in the BEA state-by-state 2014 GDP per capita list](http://www.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&stepnum=11&AreaTypeKeyGdp=0&GeoFipsGdp=XX&ClassKeyGdp=NAICS&ComponentKey=1000&IndustryKey=1&YearGdp=2014&YearGdpBegin=-1&YearGdpEnd=-1&UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=Levels&RankKeyGdp=1&Drill=1&nRange=5).So Denmark was $44,300/c in 2014, or $40,480 in chained 2009 dollars, which would make it the 13th poorest state, not tenth.  Likewise Finland would be the fifth poorest (hey, that agrees) and Sweden would also be the 13th poorest, not seventh.But what it fails to mention is that the European country which is closest to the United States in taxation/anti-poverty measure tradeoffs - the United Kingdom - would come in as the second poorest state, a bit ahead of Mississippi and far behind the Scandinavian nations.> 3. Scandinavians have lower gross and disposable incomesThe disposable income data could do with an update - most of it's a decade old - but the basic problem is that this section compares apples with oranges.  For example, childcare tends to be heavily subsidized in Scandinavia and so relatively little is paid out of parents' disposable incomes compared to their counterparts in the USA.> There is zero evidence anywhere in the world that high taxes reduce poverty. Oh look, a straw man so big that Burning Man is jealous.> [Look at what all that public spending has accomplished:](https://i.imgur.com/DvLnesP.png)What I'm seeing there is a chart from the CATO Institute that plots a comparable-between-years value (the poverty rate) against one that bakes in inflation (welfare spending), ignoring the fact that from 1976 to 2011 [prices rose by a factor of 3.953](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0).The other thing is that the poverty rate in 2011 is not directly comparable to the poverty rate in 1976.  It's [defined as](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/methods/definitions.html):> The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps.All those noncash benefits that alleviate poverty are made to not impact the poverty rate one bit, by definition.  And this has [a major impact on the headline rate](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/03/15/the-true-us-poverty-rate-is-4-5-not-14-5).> 6. Scandinavians aren’t as happy as Americans> Let’s just forget all of that [happiness indices].  Instead, let’s look at **suicide rates**.Well that escalated quickly.Suicide rates are to do with how desperate a fraction (usually very small at any given time) of the population can be at the same time as having access to a means of suicide that permits them to bypass their survival instincts.  It has very little to do with how happy or unhappy the average inhabitant is.  Have a look at the [state-by-state suicide rate](https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures) - all those Californians, Illinoisians, New Yorkers and Massachusettsans are clearly pleased as punch (at their tax rates presumably) by the illogic employed here.Besides, their own source only lists 26 countries and the US rate (10.1 per 100,000 per year) is barely lower than Norway's (10.9), Sweden's (11.1), or Denmark's (11.3).  There's a strong hint in the state-by-state map at a latitudinal component to the suicide rate (which would quite plausibly suggest S.A.D. as a causative factor) and the main population centers of Scandinavia are at about the same latitude as Alaska's (with its 23.07 rate).Plus their own source uses 2005 data.  [2012 data from the WHO](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDE?lang=en) has the US rate at 12.1, the Norwegian rate at 9.1, the Swedish rate at 11.1 and the Danish rate at 8.8.  Since TFA was written before the close of 2012 it's understandable that they didn't have any more recent figures to hand, but history has flipped their point 6 completely on its head.Lol, really?Ok but just glancing through this is see ridiculous logic gaps. It's late for me butnif nobody has responded in the morning ill put some thought into a response.I'll take a crack at one of his assertions. This guy claims: ""Every single Scandinavian country ranks higher than the United States in suicide rates. Every single country. Finland ranks 5th in the world for suicides per 100,000 people. By comparison, the United States ranks 18th."" However, his source is from a decade old Washington Post article that only has twenty-some-odd countries:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/suiciderate.htmlHe says, ""Every single Scandinavian country ranks higher than the United States in suicide rates."" According to the World Health Organization, only Finland and Iceland has a higher rate of suicide than the US, at 14.8 and 14.0 suicides per 100,000 people. Compare this to the US' 12.1. Never mind Finland is not part of Scandinavia, though he certainly thinks it is. Furthermore, Iceland is a *nordic* country, but it is not actually *Scandinavia*.http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDE?lang=enDenmark, Norway, and Sweden follow at 8.8, 9.1, and 11.1 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. (I'm going to ignore his statement that, ""Suicide rates are cold, hard numbers not subject to interpretation. You’re either dead by your own hand or not."" Many countries actually underreport suicide due to the stigma. This already tells me he is way off base and hasn't much of a clue of what he's talking about.)It is from a site called libsdebunked.com ....miiiiiight not be 100% factual."
140,"It's absolutely idiotic.1) Government assistance programs can be suspended or terminated if the family takes on unreported income. I knew a woman who took Section 8 who nearly had her benefits withdrawn as a result of a single anonymous complaint to HUD which alleged that her boyfriend lived with her. If they had been living together, his income and assets would have to be factored in when HUD determined eligibility.2) You can't just declare your property to be Section 8 eligible and start collecting subsidies. HUD needs to inspect the property and you need to qualify as a landlord. Also, of course, the person you're renting to must qualify for Section 8.3) Obamacare isn't free.4) You don't get free tuition for being a single mother.5) Average food stamp benefit for a family of 3 is $367:http://www.cbpp.org/research/a-quick-guide-to-snap-eligibility-and-benefits6) A free cell phone has very limited hours available.7) You don't automatically get free utilities just for being low income. Utilities are often charged on a sliding scale.8) Most of the benefits listed depend on zero income, so it's not clear how a deduction for being a head of household would help. Also, you must pay more than half of the cost of running the household to qualify as a head of household.9) Disability is very difficult to get. You can't just declare yourself crazy or disabled in order to get it. Maximum disability payment is $733 per month for an individual: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability/supplemental-security-income-ssi/income-limits-eligibility.htmPeople who are disabled and single parents often need government help in order to live. As you can see, it's just enough to keep these people alive, while ensuring that they remain completely impoverished. Some people have an issue with keeping keeping the disabled and the children of the unemployed alive, and want to return to the golden age of Charles Dickens. These people make up fables about the easy life that can be had by refusing to work and collecting government subsidies instead.""This plan is perfectly legal and **being executed now by millions of people**.""    LOL. Sure buddy.Looks like it's from a letter column, there's a lot of assumptions about what's free there. Disability is hard to get on, even if you're legitimately disabled. My older brother had his legs crushed in a logging accident, and it still took him five years to get disability. A friend's mother was basically immobilized with rheumatoid arthritis, and she had issues claiming disability.I have a feeling it'll move into tax fraud territory in the later stepsOn the other hand, I kind of want to write something like this for corporate taxes/welfare.Sounds conservative hateporn to me.Is this clipping from [Clemson University](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-tabb/9b/995/9b9)'s Tiger paper?Snopes covered this well. http://m.snopes.com/new-american-way-life/Sounds like a good plan to me.I sent an email to Politifact, any other details about where this came from?  Also, the more people email them, the more likely they can look into it.  It sounds like a mix of bullshit and tax fraud to me, though."

142,"""Prop[ping] up the stock market by printing money"" is presumably a reference to [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#US_QE1.2C_QE2.2C_and_QE3).  That, however, is entirely down to the Federal Reserve, not the President.  The bulk of QE1 - and close to half of all QE - happened in late 2008 and early 2009, while the first of Obama's nominees joined the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in January 2009.  Ben Bernanke, appointed by GWB, was Chair through 2014, and Obama's nominees did not form a majority until April 2010 (between QE1 and QE2).""Pushed a record number of Americans out of the work force"" is presumably a reference to the declining [labor force participation rate](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000) which peaked at 67.3% in 2000, was 65.7% in January 2009 and in July 2015 was 62.6%.  There's an expected long term decline in this happening now due to boomers retiring (the oldest hitting 65 in 2011) and so removing themselves from the labor force, higher student enrollment, and participation by women ceasing to compensate for the longer-term decline of participation by men.  [The CBO attributed the 3 point 2007-2013 decline](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45011-LaborMarket-OneCol.pdf) (page 13) as 1.5 points due to long-term demographic trends, 1 point to temporary weakness in employment prospects, and 0.5 points to ""unusual aspects of the slow recovery"".  However, this does not add up to ""pushed"".""Increased poverty"" -  the poverty rate rose from [13.2% in 2008 to 14.3% in 2009](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/incpovhlth/2009/highlights.html) while the latest figure available is [for 2013](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf) with it declining to 14.5% from 15.0% in 2012.  Obviously these were years in which the Great Recession and its aftermath were happening, so attribution is wanting.""[Increased] the income gap"" - the [Gini index measure of inequality](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=212325&updated=2000) rose from 0.466 in 2008 to 0.468 in 2009 and to 0.476 in the last available year, 2013.  This is part of a trend stretching back nearly 50 years, so specific attribution to Obama is left wanting justification.""Surrendered the Middle East to ISIS"" - the US-Iraq withdrawal of forces agreement, compelling US withdrawal by the end of 2011, [was signed in 2008 by President George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93Iraq_Status_of_Forces_Agreement) and the reason why there are no boots on the ground in Iraq; [thousands of airstrikes have been made against ISIS targets](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034), so this complaint apparently reduces to the failure to invade Syria and/or Iraq.""Almost doubled our debt to over $18 trillion"" - Federal debt was [$10,626,877,048,913.08](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/pd_debttothepenny.htm) on January 20th, 2009 and the latest figure (August 26th, 2015) stands at $18,151,231,820,725.70, an increase of 70.8%, if that qualifies as ""almost doubled"".  This $7.5T rise is almost exactly equal to the [entire discretionary spending budget FY09-14](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist05z6.xls) - raising the debt was not optional, even if Obama had zeroed out the discretionary budget from day 1 (and note that includes the entirety of the Defense Budget too).  There's little doubt that if Obama had zeroed out all the non-defense discretionary spending from FY09-14 the complaint would be that he had increased the national debt by almost 50%.I also like to note that there is a large intersection between the people who point to the latter number and those who claim ""Social Security is bankrupt"" or similar: if the Social Security Administration truly has no assets, then the Federal Government does not owe it [$2.7 trillion](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/fyOps.html), but that's included in the $18T figure.  Many seem to want to have it both ways.He's right about most of these, to some degree, although many people would argue who's fault each one it.1. The total national debt surged tremendously in the last year of Bush's term and the first years of Obama's. Many would argue that the surge in the debt is Bush's fault.1. Yes, the Fed has been printing huge sums of money to keep the economy going. Sooner or later this will cause inflation, but it hasn't yet.2. Yes, poverty and income inequality have grown during Obama's presidency. Again, you can argue this isn't Obama's fault, but it has happened.3. It is pretty clear that the Middle East is a much bigger mess today than it was when Bush left office.4. And, yes, Obama traded several POWs for Bergdahl*, who is now being prosecuted for having deserted his post.*Edited. Thanks, /u/PhillAholic."

144,"Ted Rall, a shitty cartoonist and thoroughly despicable human being, appears to have produced the cartoon version of [this article](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/prisons-shouldnt-create-debtors).Note, however, some crucial differences. Rall completely ignores reality and assumes that the only way to repay the debt is to commit crimes. The article doesn't say this, and there's no evidence that any crimes have been committed in order to pay back the cost of prison.Also, Rall says that if the inmate doesn't pay, he will go back to jail. This is presented as a fait accompli. The article mentions this as a possibility, but doesn't cite any instances of this happening.Rall also ignores the fact that inmates cost their fellow citizens considerably more than $25,000 per year to watch them and care for them. The article says that around 80% are indigent, but that leaves 20% who are not, and who should not be given free care just because they commit crimes.As usual, Rall is so focused on sarcasm and anger that he can barely draw a recognizable figure, and misses the best arguments for his positions as well. For example, the article points out that inmates' family members often pay the lion's share of the restitution, so the program often punishes the wrong party. Also, debt collections from former inmates are, unsurprisingly, ineffective, so the program costs the state more than it brings in."
146,"Far better to actually pull a quote or two from something and ask if that is true or not.  But to shorten the headache, yeah about 50/50 true ( I honestly only got about half way before my eyes rolled up so far I thought I had a stroke)  The whole vid follows a pattern of --Fact, fact, specious conclusion.  Simple history lesson: Republicans from 1860-1960 were dominant in the north and owned the black vote because of Lincoln.  Dems from 1932 on pushed reforms for the poor and owned the south. Post Civil rights act, the parties dominance and positions have shifted to what we know today.  Numerous Dems who wanted segregation forever simply became GOP and kept their seats in congress,(Strom Thurmond chief among them) it took till the 90's before all the moderate GOPs were purged from their last seats in the north.  TL:DR, its a fabric of half truths, the parties (both of them) have shifted their core beliefs and dominant regions over time and not simply swapped placesEdited to add ThurmondI can't respond to every single statement made in this video but this post sums up best about that LBJ quote - http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2088gl/president_lbj_ill_have_those_ns_voting_democratic/It's hard to take someone serious when they say things such as ""Obamaphone"".The first 1/2 (the part on the 19th century) is mostly true.

147,"No.Source: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/anecdotes-evidence-setting-record-straight-immigrants-and-crime-0Hmm, process for this should be as simple as finding the estimated number of illegals here (a) and frequency of crime by illegals (b). Then you'd find the population of the U.S. (p) and the frequency of crime in the U.S. (c). The next step would be solving for a/b and p/c to see what those numbers look like. You can also specify regions with high illegal immigrant density and run the same algorithm with that areas values for a, b and compare that to both that areas p/c and the general p/c. I'm on a phone or I'd do it myself.   Edit: I am not a statistician so if I am wrong and anyone can tell me why, I really do want to know.   Edit: I'm on a phone, not a computer.There are plenty of immigrants around here, I don't know if they have green cards or not, but they seem to be very wary of attracting police attention.

148,"No idea, it hasn't been made public yet as negotiations are ongoing.From what I see in the draft uploaded to Wikileaks, no, there is no explicit requirement in this regard.However, the TPP will be a ""framework"". The language of the TPP thus far speaks to limitations on ISP liability, and a uniform creation of laws governing copyright violations in the digital domain.What I DO see is the TPP giving ISPs an incentive to avoid liability by 'encouraging' them to proactively limit copyright infringement. So the answer is **no**. However, if you rephrase the question, ""Would the TPP strongly coerce ISPs to police copyright violations on their own because of their fear of large civil and criminal penalties?"", the answer is yes.Of course... the TPP is not yet final. And you probably won't get to see it until it's too late."
149,"Keep in mind that when Breivik killed 80 people in one go, he killed almost 3 years worth of people in Norway.About 30 people are killed in Norway each year. Breivik killed 77 in a few hours.If you scale it up to the population of the US, he would have to kill almost 5000 to match it. So of course these statistics are misleading.Obama said that it doesn't happen with the same frequency as other countries. He was 100% correct. We have more mass shootings than any other country.Even if you adjust for population size and look at the rate per X number of people we still lead the advanced world (to use the presidents words)I've seen that statistic thrown about on multiple right-wing blogs, but I have yet to find a reputable source, even when searching through OECD. It seems to me that someone had fun with the statistics to force a point of view that doesn't really exist. I remember not too long ago reading a discussion on /r/Europe on a map about murders per capita. Surprisingly Norway was way up on the list, next to Russia, but someone pointed out that the 2011 massacre forced its stats that high because of the small population and number of fatalities. http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/20/america-is-a-violent-country/• The US is a much more violent country than its counterparts, if you examine violent assaults per capita. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2012/12/firearm-OECD-UN-data3.jpg• This chart, actually from OECD, shows that firearm murder rates in the US are once again, much higher than those of other developed nations. The U.S. rate is more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. The U.S. rate firearm-related deaths is closer to 10 or 16 times the rates of countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain. This leads me to suspect that the screenshot you've mentioned is a croc of horse shit.Here is Politifact's breakdown of Obama's statement:>At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequencyhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/Ruling:>Obama said after the church shootings in Charleston that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."">The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014. The only partial support for Obama’s claim is that the per-capita gun-incident fatality rate in the United States does rank in the top one-third of the list of 11 countries studied. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.>EDITOR’S NOTE, June 22, 2015: We heard from several of you regarding Obama's use of the word ""frequency,"" and that frequency could refer to the incidents of mass shootings, not deaths as we examined. Looking at Obama's claim by incident, the United States has a higher rate of incidents than Finland, Norway and Switzerland. We agree that there is no preferred comparison and each is valid, and we've changed some language in this article to reflect that. We also agree that China has a larger population than the United States, a fact we weren't initially clear about but have since fixed. That said, we are sticking with our rating of Mostly False, in large measure because of Obama's claim that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" That is incorrect. We know some of you will disagree, and we'll be sure to air out some of your objections in our next reader mailbag.TL;DR the numbers are basically correct but misleading without any references as to what makes a rampage killing and why total pop matters. Well... there is so much wrong about this its almost painful but lets start with the stats; One of the 3 blogs does try to attribute the data to a ""now defunct website"" a little digging proves it was called rampageshooting.com which now links to a anti-gun website so that is useless.(they probably let the site expire and the gun control group picked it up is my guess) So lets look at the numbers; we are left to guess at the qualification that allows an event to be a 'Rampage' and what disqualifies them but the chart does show that with a given population, the US is lower than several other OECD countries, **that is surprisingly on the face of it likely true but horribly misleading.**  The reason is simple with the 3rd largest population in the world (only behind China and India) at 320ish Million we have lots and lots of people to spread the violence around whereas all the other countries on that list are much smaller so **violent incidents have a greater statistical impact (i.e. 1 bad apple among 1000 or 1 bad apple among 100??)**Quick diversion here) Lets try another stat that is even MORE forgiving of US gun violence:  deaths per weapon.  From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) we can see there are 88 guns per 100 people in the US as of 2014 using the 320mil figure for population that gives us roughly 281million guns and from [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) that 2013 gun deaths was 11thousand.  That creates a figure of only .00004 deaths per US owned gun in 2014 so obviously that means guns are safe...amirite??  (yes there is a mismatch between 2013 and 2014 data, they are compared here directly because its just a 1 year gap, if I could have found the same year I would have used them) So despite the rhetoric in the blogs >""Well, let’s take a look at some facts to see if that’s actually true – although we know how liberals never let silly things like facts get in the way of a good story."" and >""Since most statistics on mass shootings in the world compare apples and oranges by not correcting for population, let’s get a chart that makes sense, shall we?"" and GASP! actual facts >""When the data are controlled for population, the United States comes out in sixth place on the Rampage Shooting Index (see index below). The U.S. continues to have the most rampage shooting deaths (one reason could be its size – The U.S. population accounts for 25 percent of the OECD total)."" The first two statements have no neutrality and are rightly considered rhetoric the third while finally sharing actual facts over rhetoric still lacks a clear study showing the methods used and the results in the chart are basically meaningless. The facts stated, however,are likely true (pretty sure they sky is blue today, and I don't need a survey to prove it) but without the methodology and stats to back up where those numbers come from it becomes pointless as my use of stats from two quoted sources prove, **if you aim to mislead its not that hard to find the numbers you want and can pretty much say what you want.**That said I'm pretty sure the stat that is most even handed in all this is gun deaths per capita and you can see that  [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) or a different version above in /u/discomntt reply. Its clear and easy to understand and I'm confident the CDC is not making up numbers. RememberLies, Damned Lies, and Statistics - Twain-Disraeli-Truman (take your pick) Edited for formattingEdited my comments on quotes from the blogshttp://www.gunviolencearchive.org/sites/default/files/toll.png?ts=1435098750I'm going to leave this un-marked for a while longer, but at this point it's looking like I'll probably be marking this claim as **Half-True**, for the following reasons:1. The statistic being cited here is *technically* probably accurate, as far as I can tell from the other comments here.2. That said, it's also very misleading. It's clearly intended to directly counter Obama's claim, but it's comparing apples and oranges. As a part of /u/lilusa's post points out, Obama's original claim was never about number of fatalities, and certainly wasn't about number of fatalities *per capita*, it was about *frequency* of mass shootings, in which case, *he* is most certainly right.3. While we're on the topic of fruit, it's also cherry-picking. They stick *only* to deaths caused in mass shootings (not taking into account other gun deaths), but add in extra qualifiers that bolster their claim.4. This measurement also ignores *context*, which is important. As /u/Groke and /u/discomntt pointed out, this statistic stretches out *one* shooting in Norway to compare it against a *trend* in America.5. As /u/qinosen points out, this question also implies that this is a statistic that *can* be measured on a per capita basis, and fails to take into account how differently these shootings disproportionately affect nations at different scales.6. Including Israel in this list is really iffy, because of the unique situation in Israel with the Palestinian conflict. To call Palestinian freedom fighters (or terrorists) ""mass shootings"" seems like a huge misnomer.Neither way of measuring things is necessarily wrong. This is a case where *everyone* is technically right, depending on how it's measured. But because this question is specifically posed in a way that it's intended to counter Obama's claim, and as such it is *misleading*, I feel the ""Half-True"" signifier is warranted.Please feel free to issue a retort if you disagree, but keep in mind, **context counts** - for example, one might argue that the rate of armed shootings in Europe drastically increased within two years of the passing of the UK's 1937 Firearms Act, and this is very true... but completely ignores the context that WWII started in 1939, making it highly misleading. Similarly, arguing that America has fewer fatalities per capita from mass shootings than other nations may be accurate... but completely ignores the context listed above, making it highly misleading.I hope that makes sense, yes?"
150,"I'm going to go ahead and nominate this one as ""should be removed by the mods.""Yes,  Bernie Sanders is a career politician. I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, though. And if you're too lazy to specify exactly what you want to know,  this sub is the wrong place to post.Bias disclaimer: I am a progressive, however I will do my best to withhold my bias.First, I'm not certain of what ""career politician"" means. He's a politician, and it's his career. In this sense, the claim is true. That claim is true of anyone that holds political office, or seeks political office.Regarding the rest: I operate on the principle that, unless a person making an assertion has provided proof of such assertion, such an assertion must be dismissed as having no basis in fact.So let's breakdown the assertions made here (that are relevant to Bernie Sanders):1. Bernie Sanders called Republicans racist and sexist.2. Sanders derided Republicans for not voting for Lynch's nomination.3. Sanders did not talk about why Lynch's nomination was being held up.4. Sanders voted against his views because Lynch is for asset forfeiture, and Lynch allowed ""convicted banking criminals [to] go free of charge.""5. Sanders voted to end a filibuster on a surveillance bill.Regarding #1: **False**. I could find no evidence supporting this claim. Regarding #2: **True.**Regarding #3: **True.** Sanders did not talk about Republicans' concerns in the video provided, and talked about Republican obstructionism. [Note: Most politicians do not make arguments for their political opposition.]Regarding #4: **Partially true.**I can find nothing on Sanders and his opinion on civil asset forfeiture. While Loretta Lynch was part of a settlement with HSBC in 2012 that helped the bank to avoid criminal charges, she did not set ""convicted banking criminals free"". [However, on the Sanders website here, he states:](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/bank-fraud) > ""State and federal authorities in 2012 decided not to indict banking giant HSBC for transferring billions of dollars to Iran and enabling Mexican drug cartels to move money illegally through its American subsidiaries.  Instead, HSBC was fined $1.92 billion for this criminal behavior and no-one went to jail.""Sanders supported and voted for someone who helped HSBC to avoid any jail time for its executives.Regarding #5: **False**. I can find nothing to support this assertion. If this is referring to the recent Rand Paul quasi-filibuster, it should be noted that Rand Paul ended the filibuster himself.you're linking to a comment from u/yankeequebec...I recognize that name because it's a frequent poster to /r/politics & /r/PoliticalDiscussion and they're very biased towards conservative talking points & against democrats/liberals. This isn't a ""fair & balanced"" opinion whatsoeverPeople acting like there was ever a legit reason to hold up Loretta Lynch's nomination are kidding themselves....this nonsense went on nearly half a year & her views had nothing to do with it. All of the examples of ""valid reasons"" republicans had to vote against her are from after her nomination had already been held up for several months (without any ""valid reasons"")It was all because the GOP attached new anti-abortion laws to a human-trafficking law, and democrats wouldn't pass it.First, the vast majority of the claims are about Lynch. There are only two claims about Sanders being made. 1. He blamed ""republican obstructionism"" for opposition to the Lynch nomination. 2. He voted for ""ending a filibuster.""1. True. Your question is about Sanders, so I didn't look through the links on Lynch too thoroughly, but the claims look very flimsy. Like that she worked at a law firm with possibly the top freedom of speech attorney in the nation, but that law firm also had white collar accounts (which she never worked on). Also, literally speaking, he was complaining about a Republican filibuster of a vote on Lynch's nomination, which had gone on longer that the nomination of almost any other presidential appointee ever. Whether you ideologically agree with it or now, ""obstructionism"" seems pretty accurate.2. False. Bold-faced lie, must have been intentional, ""pants on fire"" false. I assume /u/yankeequebec is referring to Rand Paul's filibuster of the USA FREEDOM Act (H.R. 2048, the name for a rewriting version of the USA PATRIOT act). According to [the senate.gov page for Bernie Sanders](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislation/voting-record) Sanders wasn't even in the senate on 5/20, when the filibuster occurred. He didn't vote, so there's no way someone could claim he voted to end the filibuster.Also, Rand Paul's main opposition on HR 2048 was [Mitch McConnell](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-is-playing-chicken-with-nsa-spy-program-white-house-says/2015/05/22/796e3574-00af-11e5-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html), the (republican) Majority leader, and it was a bipartisan House bill, this was never a party-line vote. Yankeequebec's entire point is that Sanders is being partisan, but this wasn't a partisan vote. If you look at the votes, there was one that was 57-42 (even that wasn't party-line though), but the rest of the votes on HR 2048 77-17, 83-14, and 67-32.These two points are also being used as proof that Sanders is partisan and votes against his beliefs. This is pretty pathetic evidence for that claim.TL;DR: Sanders has called senate republicans obstructionist for opposing Lynch. He never voted to end the USA FREEDOM Act filibuster.Look at the sources for the links. Forbes, Rolling Stone, Politico,  and a video recording of Sanders himself. What, exactly, do you refuse to believe?Consider the source:>Well, I'm going to vote for Rand Paul in the primaries, and if he becomes the Republican nominee, I will vote for him in the general election. That's all I needed to hear.  Rand Paul has done 1-2 things I can agree with.  Sanders has a list of thing I agree with.  The fact is, being a twat about whom the president chooses should be real complaints like unethical behavior, not just"" You dont agree with how they do things""No shit they [republicans] are doing to disagree with her on many actions because of whom she nominated by."
151,"Hard to tell. In general ""Research shows that *most* restrictions do not keep significant numbers of women from obtaining abortions, yet also suggests that the most coercive and burdensome restrictions can have a measurable impact on abortion rates."" If we travel back through the lens of time when abortions are banned, (or practically banned) in most states people will turn to other means by either inducing miscarriages or traveling out of the area to get an abortion (at any cost, from any sketchy person willing to do it). Logically if conservative groups were to succeed and pass restrictions overnight to make it extremely difficult then people will just seek other unsafe means to abort their child. Getting into more meaty fact based data here's the rub:Between the economy and increase in education abortion rate is actually at a near all time low. This could also be related towards millennials not caring about having kids and not being married where in the 1980's such a situation would have made someone as social outcast might also be related to the decrease in rates. So its hard to tell how much of anti-abortion movements actually work towards reducing the number of abortions and how many of them are related to the trend. We can estimate but its difficult to be certain. Here's a study from 2014http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/17/2/gpr170202.htmland here's an older study on the subject from 2005 referencing how romainians in the 60's handled birth control:http://www.columbia.edu/~cp2124/papers/unwanted_latest.pdf> will increase our nation's declining birth rateIt's grasping at straws.  The current birth rate isn't a problem that needs fixing.  At any time the US could easily balance out any decline in population by opening the immigration taps more.Worrying about birth rates sounds like a coded message that is trying to drum up fear about the decline in white population.Possibly. I remember reading in Freakenomics a positive correlation between abortion bans and spikes in crime ~16-18 years later. They thought a possible catalyst for this was all the additional unwanted babies. They also were saying this could be why there was such a dramatic drop in crime in the U.S. from the early 1970's to the 1990's.It does increase deaths of women.http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/media/fact-sheets/abortion-distorting-science-safety-legal-abortion.pdfI'm not sure any study exists, but according to [this study](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CC4QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.econ.ucsb.edu%2Faeastp%2Faresearch%2F2008%2FFinal_Abortion_Draft_Bethune_%2520Coates_Companioni.doc&ei=NvtQVeqlHoSpsAXXxYDoDQ&usg=AFQjCNHu5PZKIRimv_rRbgpgpzvNRs4s0A&sig2=PvzfcqH50ssiXqeepNStfA&bvm=bv.92885102,d.b2w) abortion **legalization** correlated with a reduction in birth rate, so it's likely that an abortion ban would lead to an increase.However, this study isn't primarily concerned with the impact of abortion legalization on birth rate, but with the claim, made popular in the book *Freakonomics*, that the drop in crime during the 90s was because of Roe v. Wade (according to this paper, that claim is untrue). So all they do is compare rates of abortion for different populations between states with abortion restrictions and states without them over different time periods. But there are so many confounding factors in birth rate (social mores, religion, income, social safety net, education, etc.) that you can't make any reliable conclusions about the direct impact on birth rate. They also found a direct trade-off between the cost/difficulty of access to abortion and the use of other contraceptives. That is, when abortion is restricted, more people use (other) contraceptives. So it's difficult to infer any direct relationship based on this study.Judging by comments here, this answer is somewhere between **Mostly True** and **Unverifiable**, and I'm inclined to lean towards the latter, since a good number of factors can affect the birth rate, and no causal relationship has been firmly demonstrated. That said, it should be noted that there does appear to be, at the very least, a correlative relationship between the two statistics, so it is indeed very possible and perhaps even likely. But we don't have enough information to say so conclusively.So positive means more sucessful births correct?> ""some claim that abortion bans will increase our nation's declining birth rate.""Source please? I'm a Pro-Life conservative and I've never heard anyone say that but you.The case against abortion is and always has been that abortion is murder and murder is wrong and ought to be criminalized, therefore abortion is wrong and ought to be criminalized. You can disagree with the soundness of the premises, but not with the validity of the argument because it is a classic A=B, B=C therefore A=C syllogism, which is about as simple and straightforward as logical arguments get."
152,"Sure, just look at how many bankers take the subway in from the suburbs to wall street.[removed]I can provide a little anecdotal evidence. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, the DART bus lines in Dallas started to really branch out to the suburbs. Prestonwood Mall was still a relatively new mall at the time, and it was one of the early stops in North Dallas that could be used as a public meeting place for suburban kids and folks coming in from the city. This unfortunately made it an ideal place for the sale and distribution of heroin to suburban kids from Plano, a neighboring suburb, where heroin addiction was running rampant at the time. In the space of a about five years, the mall went from being a vibrant, relatively upscale shopping mall to one locked into the mall death spiral; suburban druggie kids acting like suburban druggie kids (sex just barely out of sight behind dumpsters and leaving used needles lying around in bathrooms, for two of the tamer examples) and the, frankly, racist attitudes in suburban Dallas about all of the inner city kids running around made the mall less attractive to the public and therefore the merchants. How much of the mall's ultimate fate is due to one or the other is debatable, but the beginning of the end was the DART stop opening there.ETA: http://deadmalls.com/malls/prestonwood_town_center.html"

154,"This isn't really the ideal subreddit for this sort of question (no facts to be checked).However, to answer your question as best I think I can, I think that if most people are honest with themselves, it's rare that their own personal set of beliefs perfectly match up with any major political party, and it's unrealistic to expect as much. I mean, there are a lot of issues where it isn't even a matter of support/opposition, so it's not even a binary choice. And besides, why should your opinion on, say, abortion, and your opinion on immigration, have anything to do with your opinion on how we should approach global warming? Why should your opinion on how taxes should be collected be tied to how those taxes should be spent? It's silly and frustrating!However, because of how our voting system works, we pretty much end up getting sorted into one party or another, and even if you find a third party is more aligned with your own personal beliefs, odds are good that it still doesn't fit *everything* you believe in. In the end, you just have to find the party that you feel *best* suits your interests, and learn to accept that no party will perfectly represent all of them.Now, you can certainly go down a list of issues and determine how you feel about each of them. I don't know any one site offhand that offers a comprehensive unbiased rundown of the pros and cons regarding each side of every major issue, although there are almost certainly websites out there that *try*. In the end, if you feel like you need to better see the arguments for each side, just search on Google for websites that advocate for each side and see what they each have to say about the issue. If one side appeals to you, but the other side makes what you feel is a valid point, see how the other side responds to that point and whether that changes your opinion.In the end, I don't think you'll ever be able to say ""I'm Party X!"" to explain your opinion on issue Y - if you're a talking with someone about abortion and simply say ""I'm a Democrat!"", that won't answer any questions or concerns they may have, and really just make you look like a tool more than anything. If you believe in a political position, you should be able to explain your belief in that position.I, for example, don't support efforts to stop global warming *because* I vote Democrat (more often than any other party, anyway), I vote Democrat in part because I believe we need to stop global warming, and I believe that because an overwhelming majority of scientists believes it to be a very real and dangerous threat to humanity.Now, if you want to find what party best *represents* you and your opinions, you can definitely check out one of many websites like the PoliticalCompass website that FeelTheH8 pointed you to. But if you want to know *why* you feel the way you do, that's something you need to answer for yourself, and ""I'm Party X"" isn't an answer to why you feel a certain way on an issue, it's an answer to what you *do* with those beliefs."
155,">I mention political correctness here because it only hampers effectiveness. For example, a lot of time, effort, and lives were wasted in Fallujah, Iraq, because the terrorists were hiding among the people and using them as shields. Political correctness dictates that we play their game. I would have announced via bullhorn and leaflets that in 72 hours Fallujah was going to become part of the desert because there were substantial numbers of terrorists hiding there. This would have given people time to flee.--Ben Carson, in his book *America the Beautiful*, p. 136.http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ben_Carson_Homeland_Security.htmI didn't read the book and I don't have access to it, but *On the Issues* is a generally reliable source.EDIT: *America the Beautiful* was published quite recently, in 2012. You can read it online for free, and the quote does appear on p. 136:http://www.amazon.com/America-Beautiful-Rediscovering-Nation-Great/dp/0310330912Are you looking for the quotation from Carson or for Carson's source? This sounds like a counterfactual opinion, and so unverifiable, short of time travel.It's possible a high ranking US military officer or analyst made similar claims, and Carson was referring to that. That opinion would provide some justification for Carson's claim, but it'd still be impossible to know whether that course of action would have actually been better."

158,"http://www.popsci.com/slippery-truths/?image=1the long and short of their view is that it will help to reduce foreign oil imports, but that there will likely be leaks in areas that are sensitive. The long term jobs created will be fewer than that in your average Walgreens. So we're trading environmental risk for becoming less dependent on foreign oil and a short term burst of jobs in its construction. They also take the view that if it isn't built the tar sand mining will likely continue, it will just get transported via existing pipelines.my .02 is that it isn't worth it. it's not as bad as environmentalists claim (stopping it isn't likely to reduce the dirty oil mining), but the benefits don't outweigh the risk of spills. The fact that republicans took a lot of money from lobbyists and are making false claims doesnt help the pro-XL argument either. Although it won't stop the tar sands from being mined, helping them do cheaper it isn't something I want to do.

159,"I haven't thoroughly studied Medicare, but I have thoroughly studied Obamacare, and I can copy-paste the pertinent answer regarding the ACA from [my post on the topic from years back](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx?context=5#c530lfx):> **Obamacare will cost trillions and put us in massive debt!**: The PPACA will cost a lot of money... at first. $1.7 Trillion. Yikes, right? But that's just to get the ball rolling. You see, amongst the things built into the bill are new taxes - on insurers, pharmaceutical companies, tanning salons, and a slight increase in taxes on people who make over $200K (an increase of less than 1%). Additionally, the bill cuts some stuff from Medicare that's not really working, and generally tries to make everything work more efficiently. Also, the increased focus on preventative care (making sure people don't get sick in the first place), should help to save money the government already spends on emergency care for these same people. Basically, by catching illnesses early, we're not spending as much on emergency room visits. According to the Congressional Budget Office, who studies these things, the ultimate result is that this bill will reduce the yearly deficit by $109 billion ( [Source](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471) ). By the year 2021, the bill will actually have paid itself and started bringing in more money than it cost.So to answer half of your question, yes, after initially costing quite a lot, over time the Affordable Care Act saves taxpayers money and ends up paying for itself and putting money *back* into the system.**Part 2**Okay, so I did a little digging around. The go-to place for government expenditures tends to be the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), so I ran a search there and came up with [this](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45552):> The federal government spent $59 billion net of premiums on Part D in [2013]; after accounting for certain payments from states under the program, the net federal cost was $50 billionThese numbers are *way* off your number of $1 Trillion, so I checked your source:> **Through 2012**, Medicare Part D added $318 billion to the national debt [...] Medicare Part D will add $852 billion to the debt **over the next 10 years**.So the person in question isn't looking at the budget on a yearly basis, as I did with the CBO link above, it's calculating the cost *since the program began*, and even projecting it *10 years in the future*.I'm not sure that this is the best way to judge spending on a government program, but if we're to compare it to the Affordable Care Act, there doesn't seem to be a better alternative, since the ACA had a massive up-front cost but ultimately amounts to a net-positive budget (as I pointed out in my other post). To limit our look to one year would either fail to take in the entirety of the ACA's costs, or fail to take in the entirety its benefits (depending on the year in question).However, if we're to look at each of the two programs over the entirety of its lifespan (assuming that each continues in its current state indefinitely), then the numbers ultimately matter little - all we really need to know is that Medicare Part D costs us money every year, and the Affordable Care Act saves us money (compared to what our budget would be without these programs).This of course does not take into account social or indirect costs and benefits (one side claiming the taxes to fund measures like these stifles business, the other claiming that having an uninsured and sick populace harms the economy), but I think those are both completely separate arguments that are a lot harder to prove one way or another.It also bears mention that *none* of this tells us anything about whether these programs are *worth* what they do (or don't) cost. Just because one costs money and the other saves money doesn't necessarily mean that one is good and the other is bad, or vice versa. Something like *that* is a far more nuanced question that really depends on your own personal positions on a number of fiscal and social issues.**tl;dr** - Forget the numbers - that really depends on what period of time you use to judge the costs of each program. All that really matters for the brunt of this claim is that Medicare Part D ultimately costs money in the long-run, and that the ACA saves money in the long-run (compared to these programs not being present). As such, unless someone else comes in with a strong claim to the contrary, I'm going to label this post **Confirmed** or **Mostly  True****Edit**: Oh, one more thing: You used the word ""deficit"", but what you *meant* was ""national debt"". The two terms mean *very* different things.**Edit 2**: Marked this as **Mostly True**. The claim mixes up ""deficit"" and ""national debt"", and the amount in question depends on the time frame you select, but at it's core, the assertion it's making is undeniably true - Medicare Part D costs money, and the Affordable Care Act saves money."

162,"You're reading that wrong - it's not saying it's tens of millions cheaper *per person*, but overall for the state. The main cost isn't from the execution, but from the original trial as well as the lengthy and costly appeals process, which requires a lot of work by lawyers to make *absolutely sure* that the state isn't about to execute an innocent person. (Which still fails, but they have to make their best effort to try.)There are lots of studies with lots of info, and googling ""cost of execution"" will auto-suggest ""vs. life imprisonment.""Here's one that seems to have citations and stuff:http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty...and it's not a political fact that is ""thrown around,"" it's an economic one.> I can't fathom what would account for even 1% of that cost.I don't have hard numbers, but it's the guaranteed appeals of the death row inmate that account for most of the cost.> Let's assume housing an inmate for their entire natural life (say, 30 more years) costs $0 (which it obviously doesn't).It depends on the prison, but you can figure $50,000 to $75,000 per year to house and feed an inmate at a maximum security facility.I believe there is a misunderstanding.  The author refers to ""killers"" and seems to be referring to the all death row inmates, nationally.  The author's ""tens of millions"" is for the whole system.  You seem to be referring to a single inmate costing $20 million more, individually.  More generally, the extra costs for a death-row inmate come from added legal fees from the appeals process as well as higher costs of segregated imprisonment (individual cells, more guards, etc).   Since prisons are divided by state and federal jurisdictions, it's difficult to provide a single source on such a broad topic.  [Death Penalty Information Center](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty#financialfacts), while an advocacy group, does provide links to some primary sources.Hope this helps![This might help with some real numbers.](http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Price_of_Prisons_updated_version_072512.pdf)TL, DR: it costs anywhere from $14k - $50k per year to put someone in prison."

164,"In January, the Atlantic wrote a piece on this question. Their summary was more like $62.6 billion per year. http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/More detailed analysis here: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/how-washington-could-make-college-tuition-free-without-spending-a-penny-more-on-education/273801/The problem is that free university would create a increased demand for school, and displace other sources of funds. 1) If school were free,  now people would choose public colleges and universities instead of private ones.  There would also be less pressure to graduate in 4 years, so people might stay longer. More students would require more funding,  and even at current funding levels, many 2 year schools are already cutting back on classes. 2) Would you donate money to your school if the government was paying for it? Because universities get a lot of money in gifts. Also,  much of the savings identified would not occur just because some education is now free.  People would still get private scholarships,  companies would deduct education expenses on non university classes, etc.I'm having trouble with their view of ways we can save money, specifically concerning for-profit colleges. $1.6 billion from the GI bill went to for-profit colleges in 2011. If we stop funding for-profit colleges in this way (tell vets that they have to go to a different school), we don't magically get that money back. Those GIs don't decide they don't want to go to college because the GI bill didn't pay for ""Exploit U,"" right? It would mean more spending on public university tuition. I'm okay with that, because I think for-profit colleges broadly are a bad investment of public money. It just sounds like really optimistic accounting to me.I could be misunderstanding, and I'm sure public college education can be done since it's done in other countries.The problem of ""Fact Checking"" ensues. Somebody always has a contesting point to make against the opposing. How can anything be considered ""fact"" on any media platform, no matter how socially popular it is?Just 12.4 Billion that's a lot of money. Is our nations debt not high enough?ITT: People who don't grasp economics.Some of those 'predatory for profit' schools are quite good (ie Ivy league) and some of them could easily pay off all their own students forever. (Harvard for one, its foundation has many billions and was verified in an article several years ago) This argument assumes, that the cost of all staff-workers-building maintenance-Heat/ac etc... at all 2/4 year public schools could be paid off at 12.4 billion a year.  Add in all the local Community colleges paid for with local and state taxes, and its going to be monumentally higher (120b per year more likely) buildings, salaries and just the electric bills take up a staggering amount of cash. Edit (yeah, misunderstood the context Predatory vs Private, my bad)How's that working out with primary/secondary schools? Isn't it shitty enough we make high school drop outs continue to pay taxes for their kids to drop out, or we make people pay for an education we don't give them. We already do this for state schools to a degree. A majority of tax payers don't go to college yet the get to pay for it. They earn less so another can earn more. Fuck that. If you want an education so you can get a better job learn how to make sacrifices and save the money yourself. That's not even considering how many students spend 4 years getting drunk which I wouldn't be a big deal if they actually left school with improved skills that got them a job.[removed]"

I'm coming up with 3.5% based on what is definitely a quick approximation. There may be more direct sources that have looked at this more comprehensively and for more recent budgets. He's certainly in the right ballpark.I've heard similar from Norway from doctors and aquaints in medicine. It seems both plausible(think about your grannies medical bills versus yourself or your parents) and extremely/horribly wasteful. The metric in healthcare should be 'number of quality life years'. I'd rather cure one kid of terminal cancer then give 80 90-yr olds one extra year heavily sedated in an iron lung. (Polarized analogy, but it serves to illustrate reality imo)While true on the surface, it's a little disingenuous. Doctors are rarely sure what month is a patient's ""last year of life"".I can't speak to the veracity of this claim, but I do know that we could save this country a ton of money by having people fill out Advance Directives as part of the health insurance enrollment process.http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/02/28/283444163/episode-521-the-town-that-loves-deathIt seems strange, that we don't take end-of-life responsibility for ourselves. Instead, we're expected to ""die of natural causes"" (basically something gets so old it doesn't work any more). Why not save resources for the greater species and commit to a suicide clinic, or something else? I know it's not politically correct to suggest everyone kill themselves in their geriatric years but honestly, how many fish are you gonna catch and throw back, how many reruns of Maury can you watch, and how much time do you really want to spend outside on a lawn chair staring at your lawn, wasting water to keep it a pretty green just because?I like to think that 2 or 3 generations from now, this will be a more acceptable, and maybe even honorable, decision to make.True or false I'm thinking so what?  He might as well be saying that people with health problems are more expensive in the healthcare industry than people who are healthy.  Yah... Obviously.  So?  What?  Should we decide that people should die at a specific age to save the rest of us money?!  Transform Retirement Age into Death Age?!  I saw a Star Trek: The Next Generation episode where a brilliant man followed his culture's tradition of killing their people at a specific age, even though by so doing the loss of his ability and knowledge could mean the destruction of their world, and extinction of their race.  Anybody who thinks it's a good idea to kill off those among us who have health problems should be the first to go.  Bye bye, not gonna miss ya.I do think that people should have a right to decide to die.  That decision can be verified by a process that ensures that people aren't killing themselves merely because they are depressed and could get treatment and get better and live a good life.  If Bill Maher thinks the Elderly should be thrown under the bus because our Federal Government is bad at math and wastes money left and right, then I sincerely hope he gets hit by a bus."

167,"Based on everything I have heard, no business is required to pay 100%.  It is often split.  This is the basis by which people are crying about increased payments.So no, nothing in the ACA says businesses must cover 100% costs.  They ARE required (or were prior to the moron men in the supreme court) to offer healthcare based on company size.The Hobby Lobby decision had little to do with reality, and more to do with semantics. Regardless of the percentages paid by employer/employee, they were actually backed by the supreme court that 4 items covered were abortifacients. Which was what they were suing about. The supreme court, after ruling poorly on facts, then changed the ruling, twice, allowing even more organizations to sue to stop the health care mandates.Truly the saddest part of this is that it totally works against female reproductive health, and ignores all evidence. Viagra and cyalis are still covered, as well as vasectomies. Better access to birth control will really be highly effective at bringing down abortion rates. Sadly the supreme court showed how truly out of touch they are by not ruling on reality, but siding with superstition.Absolutely not.For example, I work for an extremely large corporation and the first 6 grand of my family's health care comes straight out of my pocket.Which leads to some interesting arguments with my doctor about what she prescribes for me...[according to people who actually know how work insurance works: NO -- in fact it seems they don't pay anything at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXn7U0okv4)"
168,"This is up for judicial interpretation, and relies on the ""faithful execution"" clause of Article II, Section 3, which says that the president “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”The Supreme Court has, in the past, given the executive limited authority to amend or create laws at the discretion of the Congress. This rulemaking must be guided by an ""[intelligible principle](http://www.forbes.com/2011/05/16/regulation-constitution-washington.html)"" given to the executive by the Congress. In the case of the ACA, the Congress gave a law to the President which had clear and defined dates for implementation. The President signed that law. The Executive then amended those dates later on, down the road, for one of a couple reasons:* Political Expediency: pushing implementation dates back so that they come *after* an election, and don't result in an ""October Surprise"".* Easing the burden on employers: Allowing employers more time to comply with the law so that they did not have to struggle as much to comply.* Inability to implement on that day due to circumstances the Congress could not have foreseen when creating the original implementation dates.Now, the courts is likely going to have to decide *why* the administration chose to delay implementation. If it is one of the first 2, then it will likely be found to not be within the authority of the executive, because those reasons do not override the intelligible principle given to the Executive by Congress.If it is the third reason, then the Court may determine that the Executive was simply complying with their duty to faithfully execute the laws and the Congress did not provide an alternative in case of unforeseen circumstances. So the Executive had to push the date back in order to comply with the wishes of the Congress and their own duties.Amending the dates set out by Congress is a clear violation of the President's duty to faithfully execute the laws, *unless* the government can show that a delay was needed in order for the law to be properly implemented. However, with the way that the administration reset the dates (*right* after the November elections), it appears that political expediency may have been their primary motive. In that case, the President most definitely *did* violate his own Oath of Office, and broke the law as John Boehner alleges.The Courts will decide.I hope this all makes sense, it seemed a bit rambly to me but it's the best I can do at the moment.Facts first, Obama delayed a few provisions, which is a far cry from not faithfully executing the law at all.  This will have some traction in court because it is the 'reasons' on why it was delayed that matter, and a Judge will have to sort that out. Opinion, yeah pretty sure this is a open-ended lawsuit looking for a target of opportunity. iirc GOP house voted to delay the same provisions just a couple days after the Ex,order, its unlikely they did it to agree with him, but to undercut the Ex,order, but they also under-cut their own argument.In a civil suit doesn't there have to be some damage proven."

Otherwise, Obama deports more than Bush every year. I would like to see data from before 2007 but I seriously doubt it changes the conclusion. The trend for the last 2 years has been a decline but who knows what that means.

170,"Just a guess here (not wild speculation either) I would suspect the headlines that first mentioned the July 2012 as the hottest was based on just a smaller set of measurements controlled by NOAA.  Later on, either monthly or annually they added in data from many other sources which tipped the scales lower a bit.  In the end its probably less manipulation than it is getting the news out with a smaller data-set than the final version, which happens rather often (US GDP reports, employment numbers, medical studies, take months to finalize) but the folks doing the work are happy for any press they can get so when the numbers show something surprising, they put it out, even if its not final.  BTW, July 2012 was the hottest month in my lifetime, so that's still a valid metric.A friend sent me a link to Steven Goddard's blog as ""proof"" climate change is fake.

171,"[Source](http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/8465-employer-health-benefits-2013-chartpack.pdf)  Correlation does not imply causation.  Typical of many of these claims, it's technically true but misleading and/or irrelevant. Classic false cause fallacy.  ObamaCare passed in 2010.  It is true that from 2010 through 2013 average annual premiums for family coverage did increase more than $2500.  However, here's what's wrong with the statement.  ""Since ObamaCare passed"" is an irrelevant data point.   ACA was passed March 10, 2010 but its provisions were phased in and some of it didn't go into effect until Jan 1, 2014 or maybe later.  Premiums did increase but you can't blame ACA yet.  Another bit of data that weakens the implied claim shows that premiums have been increasing at basically the same rate for many years.   You could also say that the same premiums went up over $6000 during the previous administration.I think you are trying to validate an implication, which is tough.Just answer this question first: what were average health care premiums in 2010 and what are they today? If the 2014 number is $2500 more than 2009, then you have validated the claim being made.However, the implication that any such rise is purely the fault of Obamacare is somewhere between 'unlikely' and 'pants-on-head stupid to believe'. Health care premiums have been increasing by a large margin over inflation for the last decade or more. Without Obamacare in the picture, it is entirely reasonable to believe they would have increased between 2010 and 2014, and by a large amount. You can debate the actual increase amount without Obamacare, but it would certainly have increased plenty without the ACA.In addition to the (from my limited understanding) standard rate of growth seen in premiums, how does that compare to the coverage they are receiving for their money? From what I understood, the ACA was supposed to implement minimum coverage standards as well, which may account for some increases as cheaper plans which hardly covered anything were eliminated. I really don't have any figures, I'm just pointing out a potential confounding variable.And they may have gone up $5,000 if the ACA hadn't passed. Obama just saved me $2,500!!!You know, there were also around 90,000 motor vehicle deaths since Obamacare was passed.I think he might be on to something.This is as much as I think there is, for facts.http://www.factcheck.org/2014/03/obama-mixing-and-matching-insurance-stats/The amount of carbon in the atmosphere has also increased since Obamacare passed. The statement provided by Sen. Coburn infers causation that is not questioned in the statement itself. False, regardless of whether premiums increased over time, the statement is misleading and inferential.If one is going to say Obamacare increases premiums, they must say just that.Crime rates in the western world are down significantly since I was born.Just saying."

175,"Zeifman's story has changed, but he has consistently spoken against Clinton. [In 1998 he voiced his dislike for her, but explicitly said he didn't have the power to fire her](http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/pdf/zeifman-20080404.pdf) (""If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her""). Now he claims that he **did** [fire her](http://mediamatters.org/research/2008/04/04/limbaugh-repeats-assertion-by-watergate-committ/143117).So. 1. He is definitely inflating his story, probably to stir up controversy and attention. 2. He has consistently disliked Clinton. But I think the 1998 story paints a pretty clear picture of how much his story changed.First, Zeifman probably had very little interaction with Clinton. He didn't supervise her or work with her, and she was only with the office for a few months. Second, her boss said that she ""did not stand out"" but was ""capable and cheerful."" Third, the entirety of Zeifman's 1998 description of Clinton is:>Zeifman said Robham sparked a bitter battle among Democrats by recommending the Judiciary Committee deny Nixon's lawyers the right to attend the closed-door meetings. ""Can you imagine that? This was a committee of lawyers and members of the bar, and she was saying the committee should deny the president representation,"" he said. After a lengthy behind-the-scenes debate, Zeifman said the committee decided that Nixon's lawyers could attend.So when he says she ""conspired to violate the Constitution, the Rules of the House, the Rules of the Committee and the Rules of Confidentiality"" what he means is he disagreed with her legal opinion. This was a legal opinion which he says a committee of lawyers had to debate at length to come to a decision on, so it's not like this was a cut-and-dry issue. There was room for disagreement, and it sounds like all Zeifman has is that he and Clinton disagreed.Zeifman was likely correct, and if it infringed on Nixon's right to representation, you can technically (mis)construe it as ""conspir[acy] to violate the Constitution, ..."", but really her crime was offering a contentious legal opinion which ended up being wrong. There's nothing unethical or dishonest about it, Zeifman is just blowing up that small disagreement to make it seem relevant to current debates.This doesn't directly answer the question in your title, but it gives a rather strong suggestion: Ziefman didn't have the power to fire her, and the person who did said she was cheerful, capable, and unremarkable. So I feel confident saying she was not fired for ethics violations.TL;DR: Was Clinton fired for conspiring to violate the constitution? No. Zeifman is, at the least, exaggerating. Clinton offered a legal opinion which arguably would have infringed on Nixon's right to representation, that's all.>From most accounts it seems that this is the opinion of one man with an axe to grind and a book to sell, which makes it difficult to validate his claims.Then you come out and use a [biased](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/11/15/4429164-calling-out-media-matters-bias) source like [mediamatters](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/01/22/Bullies-excerpt-Media-Matters) as your source?

It propounded that “to limit impeachable conduct to criminal offenses would be incompatible with the evidence concerning the constitutional meaning of the phrase … and would frustrate the purpose that the framers intended for impeachment.” It seems that this also is the opinion of one man with a book to sell, which makes it difficult to validate his claims.[removed]No."
176,"This is the response I just got from an email I wrote to one Senator....Thank you for taking the time to contact me in support of proposed gainful employment regulations under consideration by the Department of Education. Like you, I believe our nation's students should have access to a quality and affordable higher education that provides them with the skills necessary to realize his or her goals and contribute to our social and economic growth.In our competitive 21st century economy, postsecondary education is more important than ever. The Higher Education Act of 1965 provides aid for several kinds of postsecondary education, including that, which, as a condition of eligibility for federal assistance, must prepare students for ""gainful employment"" in certain occupations. In recent years, however, a number of career education programs at private sector colleges receiving federal aid have come under scrutiny for not delivering the marketable knowledge and skills necessary to improve students' employment opportunities.In response to consumer concerns, on March 14, 2014, the Department of Education issued proposed regulations to better define gainful employment. The proposed regulations set accountability measures, public disclosure requirements, and certification standards that would determine an institution's eligibility to qualify for federal assistance. Among other things, the performance measures include ratios measuring graduates' loan default rates and whether a program's students have enough earnings from employment to repay their loans. Specifically, the proposed regulations determine that a career education program meets gainful employment standards if estimated loan payments for their student population fall below 20 percent of discretionary income or 8 percent of annual income. In addition, career education programs must ensure that the default rate of their former students does not exceed 30 percent.  Many programs that would fall under these gainful employment regulations offer education and training programs that have become popular with prospective and enrolled students because of their accessibility, flexibility, and specificity.  With millions unemployed or underemployed across this country, many Americans are returning to school to gain the marketable skills needed to be hired and get back into the workforce.  Institutions that offer certificate and non-degree programs are an affordable alternative for predominantly non-traditional students who are looking to get the education and skills needed to go back to work or those who go to school part-time while also working and raising a family.The Department of Education opened a 60-day public comment period for stakeholders to submit their feedback on the proposed regulations. As your Senator, I will continue to closely monitor this issue and listen to the concerns of affected institutions and their students.Here's the government's view of gainful employment: [Obama Administration Takes Action to Protect Americans from Predatory, Poor-Performing Career Colleges](http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-takes-action-protect-americans-predatory-poor-performing-ca)Not exactly a neutral position.  Some very damaging assumptions about trade schools.For those interested, here's the Department of Education web page where they track the progress of the gainful employment rule: [Negotiated Rulemaking 2013-2014 -- Gainful Employment](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2012/gainfulemployment.html)Why pass this law for just for-profits? Why not non-profit schools as well?"

182,"Let's look at the facts from [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion) Wikipedia article.> In 1791 Congress passed a tax on Farmers who used leftover grain and corn in the form of whiskey as a medium to exchange goods.  This protest by the farmers became known as the Whiskey Insurrection.Today; Bundy is protesting against a grazing tax set up by the federal government that according to MSNBC, existed eight years before Bundy began grazing.  The farmers of the Whiskey Insurrection/Rebellion were fighting in their words, the principles of the American Revolution.  Bundy, according to MSNBC, is fighting because he doesn't want to pay any taxes.> After 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville Washington sent peace commissioners to negotiate while at the same time calling on the governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax.From what I know of this situation dealing with Bundy, federal officials from the Bureau of Land Management arrived, armed, to take away cattle (a repo if you will).  They were met with an armed protest which prevented them from filling out their requirement.  Everything seems relatively the same so far.However; the situation is slightly different which could change a lot of things.  According to the article again the Battle of Bower Hill where armed rebels attacked General Nevilles home isn't what happened in Nevada.  This attack is what brought about the 13,000 men President Washington sent to quell the Insurrection.  In Nevada, no one has been shot at or killed and hopefully that doesn't happen.  What started in the Whisky Rebellion as a tax inspector handing out writs or citations and ended in the attempted murder/kidnapping of a federal official.What is happening now could go either way and if either side starts shooting it could escalate but the environment is widely different then those days.  Particularly the federal officials, they are not going to be the first to fire.  At this point it is safe to say the BLM officials there are taking the form of the tax inspector in the Whiskey Rebellion that predated the Battle of Bower Hill.  Whether a further armed federal force, or the national guard, intervene is left up to whether or not Bundy and his allies step down or escalate things.  TL;DR.  Washington sent an army to break up the rebellion **after** the rebels attacked a federal official.  He would not send an armed military force to attack a group of protesters.Edit: Fixed linkI don't understand.. does the creator of that image want *Obama* leading the national guard into battle?http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_RebellionSeems right to me.No, it is not true, because George Washington has been dead for over 200 years.george washington would probably be wondering why there were blacks and women in the BLM, the US Marshalls and the ATF, since blacks were slaves and women typically stayed at home and raised the kids when he was alive. he'd probably also wonder how he got FF 200 years in time.and I think we'd all be wondering that last one as well.but somehow I don't think this addresses subbys question."
183,"[Here's](http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/02/US-FLORIDA0214.gif) the graphic at thomsonreuters.com (to show that they did publish it).The designer is [Christine Chan](https://twitter.com/ChristineHHChan). She says [here](https://twitter.com/ChristineHHChan/status/455971685783441408) that her inspiration was a graphic that depicted Iraq war deaths as dripping blood, and tried for a similar effect. She acknowledges on her feed that it was confusing.Is there correlating data that provides statistics on those killed in commission of a crime vs. being killed as a result of a crime?Fascinating.  That's maybe the worst graphic I've personally ever seen.  You learn more in that graphic about how to make a good graphic because Chan does it so badly.  This would be great fodder for class.For people interested in studies evaluating the effect of Florida's ""stand your ground"" on deaths, there's two excellent studies by economists.  One was published last year in the Journal of Human Resources; the other I'm not sure where it is yet.  Anyhow, different authors, different data, both find very similar things.  http://econweb.tamu.edu/mhoekstra/castle_doctrine.pdfhttp://ftp.iza.org/dp6705.pdfThey have the same graph - flipped upside down - at the bottom of the page.I think it's an incredibly weird way to present the data, but I wouldn't read too much into it."
184,"Firstly, given that multiple claims are being made here, this likely can't conclusively be marked ""true"" or ""false"".Secondly, it bears mention that many of the additional taxes the ACA adds are on a fraction of the population. Most people, for example, don't use FSAs, and the individual mandate doesn't apply if your income is under a certain level. These are new taxes, but that doesn't mean they're going to affect most people.As for the claim that Congress exempted themselves, I don't have my source on me at the moment, but IIRC, that's flat-out BS, and Congress was actually *required* to go on the health exchanges. I'll try to look into this more when I have time.Well, its also branding. ""Medicine Cabinet Tax"" description is true, but to label it a ""tax"" is a stretch. Whenever you are saving the government money, it has to come from somewhere. If you have a prescription it doesn't affect you, but you can't just go buy a bunch of Advil and bandages now with your FSA.""Special Needs Kids Tax"": yes, FSAs are more restricted as described above, but there is a lots that helps ""special needs kids"" in the bill and its probably a net benefit.Employer Mandate/individual mandate tax: this is the most literal one.I rate it half to mostly true in that there isn't anything blatantly false, but the language is very loaded and slanted to say that because FSAs are more restricted, its a tax on vulnerable groups.source: I'm a health actuary[removed]"

186,"[deleted]I'm not sure about the number of LGBT couples who want to adopt, but [most people who adopt want to adopt babies or very young children,](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865578356/Adoption-often-leaves-older-children-behind-alone-but-waiting-families-change-the-future.html?pg=all) and the [average age of children in foster care is about 9 years.](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/afcarsreport20.pdf) In addition, over half of foster children end up back with their families (see the previous link). So regardless of how many LGBT couples want to adopt, I'm not sure they would have a substantial effect on the number of kids in foster care.Regardless of what the facts may be, there would be less children in foster care if qualified people of all types were allowed to adopt. Many less children.Willing to adopt is a suspect phrase.  First, when we ask people about adoption they invariably think about adopting a healthy, infant, same-raced child.  The children in the foster system do not hold to that image.  Given that the white people are the majority of both the gay and straight communities it is worth pointing out that there is a line around the block and down the street to adopt white babies, healthy or otherwise.  Black children and older kids have appreciably lower adoptive rates, and though we have no information to suggest that the aforementioned gay couples wouldn't adopt older or other raced kids, there isn't any terribly strong reason to assume they would approach chat differently than straight couples.The implication here is that if we let LGBT couples adopt we wouldn't have kids in foster care.  I think that's a stretch."

While the amount of money collected from taxes on religious organizations would be enough to cover food stamps and provide housing, this is considering that religious organizations would continue to make the same amount of money even after these taxes are in place. It's naive at the very least to assume that donations to religious organizations would not change with the introduction of a tax. On top of that, it's possible that many religious organizations would simply cease to be ""religious"" to maintain tax exempt status.Meh its dubious at best. Churches are tax exempt and have special rules during filing time ie not required to file a 990. Plus if you assume they are taxable you also have to assume they will be allowed the same deductions as other businesses. Even still this assumes all donatiodonations are taxable which is not true, furthermore if churches are removed from 501c3 status they could still be counted as a 501c7 so.... could be meat, could be cake, could be meatcake"
189,"Just to establish the ""today"".  These numbers appear to be the most accurate numbers available on 20 Jan 2014.GDP numbers are 1Q 2009 compared to 3Q 2013. It would be fairer to compare the same quarter 5 years apart. So, 4Q 2009 was -8.3, 4Q 2013 was 3.2.  This comparison makes Obama look even better.Unemployment rate for jan 2009 is correct. Unemployment rate for jan 2014 is 6.6%, a little lower than grandma's graphic.Here's the [Dow Jones Average by quarter](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/historical/djia2000.html), from 2000 to the present.  As you can see, the numbers in the graphic are somewhat accurate, but misleading.  Looking at the years 2004 - 2013, you can see that the 2013 number is near where it should be, based on inflation, but the 2009 number is a statistical aberration.The same is true of the other numbers.  In other words, accurate but misleading.While accurate, I believe this suffers from causal oversimplification and is thus misleading. The facts are that he inherited a broken system that got better. It wouldn't matter who was elected president. The economy was on fire and one of the primary focuses of any administration would have been to do what they can put it out. A lot of very well respected economists argue that the President has little to no actual influence over the economy anyway. (Goolsbee, Whaples, etc.) So while yes, the numbers are pretty accurate,  I think the sentence at the end falsely attributes the success to the President.DJI closing figure 7949.09 for 20 jan 2009. 20 jan 2014 DJI close was 16458.56.  After rounding, close enough.""Deficit GDP"" I assume is federal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.  I could not find the numbers shown.  According to the 2014 presidential budget historical tables, ""on budget "" deficit to GDP for 2009 was 11.1% and the estate for 2014 is 4.5%.  This about the same improvement as shown on the graphic.  Of everything on the graphic I am least comfortable with this figure.The economy was in the tank at the time he took office. The numbers look about right. The main issue I have with the graphic is that it implies the Obama is the reason for the improvement. Any oaf could have taken office and a slow recovery was almost certain, there was nowhere to go but up.I can take anything and positive and say it was because Obama was president. Presidents have nearly zero control on what the economy doesI wonder why national debt isn't on there? Aren't most of the economic improvements due to printing money and not an ""organic"" recovery?"

So it's possible that it saved money in one of those states.The problem with this is that drug tests typically only catch the people smoking weed, as most hard drugs are out of your system in a few days.Find out who is getting the contracts to do the testing and you'll have all the info you need in this subject.It worked in Utah.  Despite only catching 12 drug users in actual tests, an additional 247 people flagged as likely users refused the test and dropped out.  That, according to the sponsor of the law, saved Utah more than 10x the cost of the program.Here's a [HuffPo article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/welfare-drug-testing_n_3822750.html) (beware of sensationalist headline).Perhaps the social benefit goes beyond the costs. If it encourages 20-30% to give up using perhaps they can right their lives enough to support themselves one day."
192,"Republicans would be right if ISPs were not near-monopolistic. Unfortunately, the requirement in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that incumbent telecom providers (for DSL) allow for wholesale access to their networks to new entrants was repealed by the Bush era FCC in 2005. This combined with the lack of wholesale access in cable means that its virtually impossible for new entrants to provide telecom services.Look at the deregulated energy markets, my power company only supplies me with wind energy, this is what I want and it costs me a little extra each month. If the same were true in the telecom sector, and cable and DSL companies provided wholesale access to smaller companies, I could choose to be a customer of a company that values net neutrality, or privacy, or prioritizes a service I care about (like Netflix).Unfortunately, I can only choose between two companies: Comcast and a major DSL service. Both of these companies extensively lobby against any regulations. I beg Republicans to pick between two visions. Either support a regulated monopoly where major telecom companies have to follow Net Netrality principles, or support forcing these companies to allow for competition through wholesale carrier rules.A bit of both. Without net neutrality, power lies in the hands of a few very large corporations, who can make access to some websites easier than others. Net neutrality rules give regulatory power to the government, but power of speech/access to the people.They're kind of both right.  When the FCC says ""the people"" they mean the customers of the ISPs. By regulating it, yes, the government has more power, but then, so do the people. (as opposed to the handful of executives at the 4 or 5 main ISPs in the US)"
193,"Please keep comments to fact-checking and objective discussion only. OP wants to know whether the Senator's church influenced his political stance. Comments regarding the legitimacy of religion, the the Establishment Clause/Separation of Church and State, or partisan politics have no place here.Thank you!I could only find [one news source](http://www.kswo.com/story/24647268/sb-1126-the-legalization-of-marijuana) for this that didn't seem to be rabidly pro-legalization or anti-church.I'm not ready to mark this as BS, but I'm not seeing much information that doesn't come with a pretty heavy bias.It appears that this quote was attributed to him by a colleague from across the aisle. This story was first broken by a rather partisan blog called the ""Red Dirt Report"". In the article, State Sen. Constance Johnson (D-Forest Park)--who sponsored the bill--is quoted as saying that Barrington opposed the bill because of his church.From [the article](http://www.kswo.com/story/24647268/sb-1126-the-legalization-of-marijuana): >Johnson said she is discouraged that Barrington “will not hear SB 2116” because of “non-specific reasons including DA’s, ‘soft-on-crime,’ (and) his church members would not be in favor of it …”>Church members? Since when does the opinion of his church interfere with public policy affecting ALL Oklahomans? Red Dirt then tried to contact Barrington's office, and received no response.However, Barrington did give his own reason to another news outlet, local station KSWO. In [that article](http://www.kswo.com/story/24647268/sb-1126-the-legalization-of-marijuana), a different reason is given:>Senator Don Barrington, Lawton Republican, says a similar bill was introduced in last year's legislative session and voted down, and that's why he says he won't hear the bill in his Senate Subcommittee on Public Safety. Barrington believes this is just another way to get marijuana legalized by changing the language of the previous bill.>""When legislation is passed, there are unintended consequences and I think the legislation I reviewed would lead to unintended consequences. I don't think parameters are put in place that can handle it,"" said Senator Barrington.>Barrington says a bill very similar to this one was heard by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee last session and voted down.And a bit farther down....:>Barrington's phone has been ringing off the hook from constituents upset with his decision, but he says rude messages and calls won't change his mind.>""I'm not here to judge her or her legislation. It's my job as a committee chairman to review legislation and, I don't recall how many bills have been assigned to my committee this year, but it's to give hearing to those bills that support good legislation,"" said Barrington.""So, I would rate this claim by Red Dirt and Sen. Johnson likely false. The only claims about his church members are from people who are politically opposed to him, and he claims that he won't change his mind regardless of what his constituents think (that would include his church).[This](http://www.walnutridgechurch.com/guest_info/images/baptist_faith_and_message.pdf) is the church charter for the Walnut Ridge Baptist Church, of which Don Barrington is a member.  In it, it states the following:> It is the duty of Christians to try to find peace with all men. In keeping with the character and teachigns of Christ, Christians should do everything they can to put an end to war.It would seem as though this church would seek an end to the ""war on Drugs"", as it is a war, and they seek to put an end to war.> God alone is Lord of what is right and wrong. Man's sense of what is right and wrong is free from the rules and commandments of men. These rules and commandments may be different from His Word. They may not be found in His Word. Church and state should be separate.Ahem. His church would want him to act in a manner separate from his religious beliefs. Pulling his church into this discussion is a violation of the Church charter itself. The church would want him to act of his own volition. His claim that his church is against this measure is false. Or, perhaps his church is violating it's own charter, which is also possible.[removed]> I can verify that he's against it, but haven't verified that his decision is made because of any church, his or otherwise.Do we have any verification that he even made the above statement, aside from whether or not it was true?"
195,"It is exceedingly likely that her cancelled, cheap insurance plan sucked. That's true of the great majority of such plans.

They talk about taxes like they're so complicated, no one could understand.  That's not a fact, that's an opinion.

Here's an example of cherry picked data from the acid rain section (which they put in the natural pollution section):>Water has a pH of 7 (neutral on the pH scale), but various natural and manmade substances in the atmosphere can combine with water to change its pH level. Natural substances account for a *tiny* part of acid rain.  Things like volcanos can cause acid rain, but acid rain affects buildings and statues in the northeast.  You'll notice there's no volcanoes near Boston, yet they still have to cover the statues in winter.They also conveniently leave out the results of cap and trade and the Clean Air Act.  Since the 1990s, SO2 emissions have dropped 40%, and acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976. So while they may show facts, the facts they show are very cherry picked.I have to give them credit, I don't think their bias would be noticeable upon a superficial evaluation.

199,"Wages can be garnished for medical bills but that's always been the case. Not obamacare's fault.By the way, many states (Missouri is one of them) medical bills cannot go to collections as long as some payments are being made. A good friend of mine had serious bills for his MS and didn't have the ability to pay, but he send 5 dollars per month for about a year until he could get on his feet and it didn't affect his credit.I had a broken ankle go to collections in the bad old days when my snake oil insurance paid pretty much zilch of a $30,000 bill, and a family member ran up about $80,000 in bills with a short emergency, with all of them going to collections, so collections were the status quo -- so whyever would the eeeevil black man in se white house have to change the law?My guess, pure foxnutteryI'm disturbed by the number of off-point discussions and outright nonsense that has been posted here. OP, you can't prove a negative. Nothing in Obamacare authorizes anything special in regards to allowing doctors to sue patients that don't pay up. The truth is that under Obamacare, you are less likely to be in the position of owing a huge amount of money to a doctor because you will have insurance that will pay for your medical expenses.Wage garnishment only happens with a court order. Court orders are granted only where due process (notice and opportunity to be heard/respond) is observed. Also, for the people stating the IRS cannot garnish your wages -- you are ignorant beyond imagination. The IRS, however, is not empowered to garnish your wages because of some 3rd party debt. It will only garnish your wages if you owe the IRS taxes!I dont have an answer to your question. But my bro n law is a VP at a hospital and he told me as long as you're making some kind of payment whether it is 10 or 1000 on a consistent basis they wont sue you. I think thats where people run into trouble. If you just stiff them they have a right to sue. I know the new laws caps out of pocket expenses but im dont think it does away with garnishments. My sister is an atty who represents a lot of low income families and deals with medicare and medicade a lot. She has had to attend a lot of ACA seminars and she is just as confused as the next person.The IRS doesn't even [have power](https://ttlc.intuit.com/health-care/1894953-will-my-wages-be-garnished-if-i-can-not-pay-the-penalty-for-not-having-healthcare) to collect the fine for not getting insurance, I don't know how your doctor could.

200,"From the article:> Walmart offers its employees two standard plans, a Health Reimbursement Account and an alternative it calls ""HRA High"" that costs more out of employees' pockets but has lower deductibles. Blue Cross Blue Shield manages both plans nationally.> Also offered is a Health Savings Account plan that includes high deductibles but allows tax-free dollars to be used for coverage.> For a monthly premium as low as roughly $40, an individual who is a Walmart HRA plan enrollee can obtain full-service coverage through a Blue Cross Blue Shield preferred provider organization. A family can get coverage for about $160 per month.We have the price of the cheaper WalMart plan, but not the more expensive plan.  We also don't know what the WalMart plan deductibles are.  We don't know how much WalMart contributes to the costs of their health insurance.We do know that the deductibles for an [Obamacare bronze plan](http://www.healthpocket.com/individual-health-insurance/bronze-health-plans#.Usyw77SFfTo) are pretty high.> Bronze Plans are designed so that insurance companies will pay 60% of covered healthcare expenses with the remaining 40% to be paid by consumers. The consumer’s expenses will be in the form of out-of-pocket fees over and above the cost of the plan’s monthly premium. Out-of-pocket expenses for individuals is expected to be capped at $6,350 annually starting in 2014.This article is so deeply confused about everything; their entire framing of their article is off the wall.They write as if Obamacare is selling insurance, which isn't the case. The policies offered on the exchanges are private sector policies for the unemployed, the self-employed, or those for whom their employer does not offer insurance, or offer inadequate coverage. In the past, these sorts of insurances had been so ridiculously expensive, that hardly any one could afford them. This essentially limited access to health services to only those employed by decent (or half-decent) companies. Which is why 20% of American lacked access to health care.These policies have always been on sale. The only difference since January is that their prices have come down so deeply, that they have become competitive with employer-granted coverage. The prices have come down due to Obamacare's combination of subsidies and policies to address the by-the-book market failures that was generating the high prices.Probably for those with benefits.  How many (%) of employees get healthcare?WA Examiner is a fringe right wing mouthpiece with no credibility in the reality based world.Most large companies are self-insured, which means the company pays the medical bills and takes on all the risk (although self-insured companies may use an insurance company as a middle-man to administer the care, it is the company that is actually paying the medical bills). Self-insured insurance plans do not need to meet the requirements of Obamacare. If Walmart is self-insured, then some may have the opinion that Walmart's health insurance is superior to Obamacare. www.AmaboCare.comWell, if Walmart wants to sell insurance policies to compete, then they must now be ACA-compliant, just like the BlueCross, Aetna, Kaiser plans now on the Obamacare exchanges. If Walmart or CostCo thinks they can do better than BlueCross, etc, more power to 'em. The exchanges were set up to encourage this kind of competition, while forbidding swiss cheese policies.You can't say they are ""better than"" some wingnut idea of what ""OBummNerScare"" is. It's just regulated insurance that must not be snake oil like the old ones were."

202,"They use the statistic of everyone who lost a plan, including those who had plans change (even a minor change) but still have coverage.I presume you're referring to [this](http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/dec/9/sen-ron-johnson-obamacare-failures-bolster-gops-ch/).Here's some dissection about similar claims [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/the-gop-says-obamacare-will-cancel-80-100-million-plans-nope/). The key takeaway is that it depends on how you define ""lost."" Plans are changing, which includes different premiums and/or benefit changes for people with catastrophic plans whose coverage is below the minimum, people who no longer have lifetime caps, those people who can now keep their children on until they turn 26, etc. What kind of changes you consider to be a loss are up to you.So without knowing how Sen. Johnson is defining lost, I would suspect he is combining the general idea of HC plans changing with those people who are seeing higher premiums due to changes in their plans. So in order to make the leap to people ""losing access to the doctors and treatments that are keeping them alive"" I suspect he's claiming that increased premium costs will put HC entirely beyond the means of the people he expects to be hearing about. Whether that's true is something time will tell.Even if the number is accurate, how many policies would been cancelled without ACA?  How many policies have been cancelled because the insured got sick?There is no statistic for cancelled policies.  Individuals in the private medical insurance market received a letter notifying them that their plan was cancelled, and they could either pick a plan on the ACA website, or sign up with the insurer for a pricier plan that met the ACA qualifications.The estimate that I heard was 6 million policy holders received a cancellation letter between October 1st and now.According to [this article](http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/05/news/economy/obamacare-insured/), 100,000 people have signed up for insurance on healthcare.gov.  So far, no one has been able to make the first insurance payment through healthcare.gov.  So technically, no one has insurance through healthcare.gov."

206,"I heard this somewhere else but it was said that the large majority of the plans that were cancelled for not meeting minimum requirements were not losses of coverage.It was explained that since the rules within the plan were changing (different deductibles and plan rules, etc) then the companies were cancelling these plans are replacing them with plans that meet minimum standards.I don't see a problem with cancelling plans that didn't meet a minimum standard. The question is, how many people have gained coverage that did not have it before, and how many people had minimum coverage before but have lost it. Those are the only two important numbers I can see.Any time the government sets a minimum standard there will be changes to what was previously offered.  Obama should have never made the statement about keeping your plan using the subjective term 'like'.  He incorrectly assumed people didn't like substandard insurance.  Too many people will claim to like rotting in a ditch if it makes Obama look bad.I heard an anecdotal report of a couple whose plan was ""dropped"", to be immediately replaced with a new (more expensive) plan that did meet the requirements of the law.  I wouldn't be surprised if this statistic counts things like that.There are many reasons why plans could have loose their grandfathered status. For example, if a plan changed its coverage to exclude treatment for any condition, then it would lose it's status.  In some cases, it could be a condition that doesn't affect the insurer, but it doesn't matter. It will lose it's status and be canceled.http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/affordable-care-acts-special-rules-for-42069/For some reason people believe the narrative that somehow the old plans were inadequate and the government knows what's best for us.  That somehow people were tricked into buying plans that they weren't satisfied with.  The facts do not support that narrative.  Many of the plans were cancel because of any of the following changes described below.>Also, implementing certain cost sharing increases such as an increase in the coinsurance percentage, the deductible or the out-of-pocket limits by more than 15 percent plus medical inflation, or an increase to co-payments by more than $5 adjusted for medical inflation or 15 percent plus medical inflation, will jeopardize grandfathered status. grandfathered status. Finally, increases in a participant’s share of premiums by more than 5 percentage points, or certain changes in annual benefits limits put grandfathered status at risk. Changes to Coverage that affect grandfathered status are viewed on a cumulative basis, not an annual basis.Simply increasing a co-payment by more than $5 would jeopardize grandfathered status.What I am not entirely clear on is, are the policies substandard because they were generally bad coverage to begin with? Or are they being considered substandard because they do not include things like maternity care, etc? in other words - where is the 'cutoff' point?so what's happened, even if we except that claim at face value is this: insurance companies are so corrupt they'd rather drop you entirely than obey the law and give you adequate coverage.This is like when that catholic-run adoption agency in new york closed rather than allow gay parents to adopt.   by FOX's/republicans/libertarians logic, the people who invented adoption were lying commies.I found [one source](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2013/11/11/aca-roundup-president-obama-apologizes-for-thousands-of-cancelled-health-plans) pretty easily.

208,"> “refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor in the decision to conduct, or the actual conduct of, such activities there and where a purpose or significant effect of such activities is to deter qualified voters from voting; and the conduct of such activities disproportionately in or directed toward districts that have a substantial proportion of racial or ethnic populations shall be considered relevant evidence of the existence of such a factor and purpose.”I don't think this is hard to follow.  The RNC are named instead of the DNC because the RNC was being specifically punished for vote suppression in a suit brought by the DNC.They're not prohibited from performing ballot security activities.  They're only prohibited if they are specifically doing so only in ""ethnic"" (ie. black/hispanic) neighbourhoods for the purpose of vote suppression.  This is because they were (illegally) targeting black neighbourhoods and got caught doing so.  The reason they ""inexplicably"" agreed to a consent order was because they wanted to avoid embarassment, which makes it pretty explicable.The terms are pretty clear.  They can do all the ballot security activity they want if they can show that they aren't just targeting black voters, but they won't do that because the only reason to do ""ballot security activity"" is to suppress black votes because, as I think we all know, there is no meaningful amount of ballot fraud.  They don't want to go harass elderly white voters because it would hurt their chances of election.One thing to keep in mind is that legal decrees are very specific. If it says that the **RNC** cannot do these **specific** activities, then that is what it means. It does not mean that the GOP in general cannot do these things. It does not mean that the RNC cannot do things not specifically on that list. So don't conflate the RNC with the GOP, and don't conflate ""ballot security measures"" with fighting voting fraud in general.So at the very base, the question of your post is answered with a no.Other considerations: decrees are valid only to the parties named in the jurisdictions covered by that court; the 3rd Circuit covers DE, NJ, and PA only; and the RNC is a specific entity, separate from lawmakers in the Congress, as well as from specific candidates and other politicians, and does not mean everyone who is a registered Republican.IF the GOP were barred from fighting vote fraud, then how have they passed so many ridiculous voter ID laws in recent years?  That being said, I'll still answer your question.What this article is talking about isn't the GOP as far as the government, but the Republican National Committee. Here is the full case:http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2328873350363328311&q=Case+No.+09-4615&hl=en&as_sdt=40006In essence, in the 80s, the RNC and the DNC both signed a ""consent decree"" limiting certain behaviors/actions at polling places by the parties.  Now, the RNC no longer wants to abide by the consent decree they signed.  They court basically says ""too bad.""Here is a relevant excerpt from the court case:>The RNC asks that our Court vacate a decree that has as its central purpose preventing the intimidation and suppression of minority voters. When, as here, a party voluntarily enters into a consent decree not once, but twice, and then waits over a quarter of a century before filing a motion to vacate or modify[6] the decree, such action gives us pause. Further, the RNC, with the advice of counsel, twice chose to limit indefinitely its ability to engage in certain activities enumerated in the Decree by entering into a decree with no expiration date.Additionally, in this lawsuit, an alternative the RNC requested was to modify the decree, WHICH THE COURT GRANTED.  The court modified the decree as requested by the RNC.WND is not worthy of skepticism, only derision. In any case, the Voting Rights Act has far more bearing on the GOP's voter suppression campaign...er, I mean...struggle against the nigh-imaginary problem of voter impersonation fraud."
209,"Sorry I don't have a link, but the Economist covered this a month or two back. They found countries with legalized abortion had lower rates of abortion.edit: [Found the article](http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21579065-brutal-farce-el-salvador-highlights-regional-failing-miscarriages-justice)While I'm sure that they are correlated, I would assume the relevant factor is a more permissive attitude towards contraceptives that would naturally accompany legalized abortion.So, I found a theory about how legalizing abortion could help raising abortion rates.http://www.patheos.com/blogs/badcatholic/2012/11/does-contraception-reduce-the-abortion-rate.htmlIt's not specifically about it, but about ""abortion culture"". About how in some cultures people already see abortion as an option if something goes wrong when they have sex.Judging cause and effect is always difficult and you cannot infer a general rule form a single observation.This article might provide some insight.http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2991902?uid=3737536&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103703482157"
210,"It's based on figures from myriad sources, including the Cato institute, the Tax Foundation, the Huffington Post, and others.   The total figure includes direct business subsidies (including farm subsidies and research incentives), business incentives at all levels of government, interest rate subsidies to banks, bank fees for retirement funds, overpriced medication as a result of government granted patent monopolies (effectively research incentives), corporate tax subsidies, and estimates for revenue losses as a result of corporate tax havens.   I'm guessing whoever made the graphic was banking on the fact that most people don't actually bother to check source urls on infographics.[http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/09/23](http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/09/23)   Note that there is a discrepancy between the figure on the graphic and the figure in the source, I'm guessing some of the figures were not counted.    The $4,000 statement allows for a very broad definition of ""corporate subsidies,"" and includes several expenses that are merely implicit.Is everyone that makes $50k a year taxed the same? Single vs having kids or owning a house, etc. Seems like a generic breakdown where they plug in percentages.(Also we spend more than we bring in via taxes, so even that wouldn't be accurate.)$4597.98 payed from a $50,000 salary? That only accounts for just under 9.2%. We're missing a lot of taxes there.I'm going to let this post stand, but in the future, please include a more accurate title."
211,"It's all or mostly accurate, as far as I know. Israel is disproportionately often the focus of many different organizations in the UN, many of whose member states are guilty of (and sometimes even represented by individuals guilty of) war crimes.

[Here](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sgsm10788.doc.htm)'s a link to a speech by Kofi Annan in which he says>Meanwhile, we must realize the promise of the Human Rights Council, which so far has clearly not justified all the hopes that so many of us placed in it.>Of course, it’s encouraging that the Council has now decided to hold a special session on Darfur next week.  I hope against hope that it will find an effective way to deal with this burning issue.>But, I am worried by its disproportionate focus on violations by Israel.  Not that Israel should be given a free pass.  Absolutely not.  But the Council should give the same attention to grave violations committed by other States as well.[A link to Freedom House's report that he mentioned](http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/un-human-rights-council-report-card-2007-2009). From the summary of the report:>The primary finding of the report is that a small but active group of countries with verypoor human rights records have so far succeeded in limiting the ability of the Council toprotect human rights, despite their minority status on that body. Member states thatFreedom House designates as Not Free make up less than one-fifth of the Council, butdevote considerable resources to their work in Geneva."
212,"So let me get this straight. You want me to factcheck Ted Cruz.... On the ACA... A topic he has a long well documented history of misconstruing. Let's look at his data. ACA requires businesses with over 50 employees to provide health insurance or pay a 3000 dollar fee. The first problem I see is how he makes the number 5000, 2000 of which is from ""taxes"". Every tax situation is different and to claim 2000 will even be average is impossible. From there he links it to the gang of 8 and immegration policy. The problem is that every perminantte resident and citizen require insurance. Illegal Immigrants don't. So while it might seem you save 5k according to Cruz by hiring illegals, if the gang of 8 bill goes through than those illegals won't be illegal anymore and required to buy insurance.[removed]"
213,"As I'm sure you might have guessed, it comes down to how you count it. The first year Obama was in office, the budget jumped by almost 20%. The question is ""was that his budget or the guy before him?"". The argument that it was his goes like this: he was in office, so it was his budget.  The argument that it wasn't takes into account the fact that budgets aren't made overnight.... And importantly, there was some pretty serious, world destabilizing shit going on in 2009. Iirc, every deficit since 2009 has shrunk.The budget for Obama's (or any new President's) first year is passed about 4 months before the next President takes office because the fiscal year actually starts before the new year.  The previous President owns that budget.  As for the deficit. This was almost entirely the result of the great recession combined with Bush jr.'s 2009 budget. [This](http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/07/news/economy/cbo_2009_budget_outlook/) CBO report from before Obama took office, shows the projected $1.2 trillion deficit for 2009. This takes into account the budget that was already passed by Bush and the 08 congress. This is why people say he inherited the deficit. However Obama was very much responsible for passing the stimulus which, even when added to the 2009 budget, still leaves him more thrifty than the Presidents preceding him, as the forbes article you linked to shows. Breitbart's source also uses the fact that the dems controlled congress in 08 to blame Obama for the budget deficit, ignoring the fallacy in singling out one congressman from one party amongst a bipartisan agreement like this one, he then goes on to count all budgets since then as solely Obama's responsibility, ignoring the fact that Republicans took the house after 2 years.  This is not an accurate comparison. If he wants to combine congressional participation in budget agreements, he must do it all the way through. Really the trumping factor of it all, is that Breitbart's accusation counts money ""nominally"" or ""not including inflation.""  Indeed just about every new President will be the largest spender in history because inflation increases as time goes on.  This is not an accurate depiction of how much of our available funds are actually being spent historically. To accurately compare to historic expenditures, inflation MUST be included. For instance, [we would have had to spend about 16 trillion dollars in 2013 to match a 1 trillion dollar expenditure during WWII.](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm).This goes for any monetary comparison including the comparison to historic debt, which the Breitbart claim does not do.  The truth is, it is impossible to accumulate more real (inflation adjusted) spending than all Presidents combined.  We simply do not have anywhere near that much real money available to us.Probably both true.  Stats work like that.  However, spending, deficits and debt don't matter unless you apply value to what came of it.  One guy spent only $7 and the next guy spent $14.  Way to go, first guy.   Maybe the first guy spent $1000 on some 30"" rims and screwed up the tranmission.  Then the second guy had to replace the transmission for $1500.  Oh look, the second guy spent more money, what an idiot. /s"

215,"24 bought insurance under California's exchange. I pay 80 a month now down from 270.[deleted]From CNN> On the flip side, a young man who never visits the doctor and wants to minimize his monthly charge could opt for a bronze plan. A 40-year-old enrolling in this plan could pay as little as $219 a month. But, if he did get sick, he'd get socked with a $5,000 deductible, $60 co-pays for primary care visits and a $300 emergency room charge.It's false; one cannot estimate an exact cost per month with an undefined age and undefined location. ""Will"" infers an exact estimation; had they used ""may have to pay as much as"" or ""may have to pay at least"" that would be possible for verification using vague generalities of age and location. But without a defined age range (young person) or location (they vary state to state), it is impossible to estimate an exact cost. Their premise is flawed and therefore the argument is invalid.it depends what plan you pick and what state you live in, the average is probably $250 because each company is likely to display 5 premuim (170+ per month) and only 1 plan that is barebones at >$10021 and able to get a silver plan for a total of $1.61 a month.What income level?What age?What State?This seems to be accurate before subsidies, but the title is misleading because this is the price it costs, just not what is paid.23, Bronze: $270/month, $4000 deductible - with $4800 total income this year due to disabilities. Through NY exchange, presented with 6 plans, all within $1 of each other. Not affordable.Suggested I apply for medicaid instead, but may not get it due to family household income where I only get basic necessities, and was emancipated at 18 which took me off of famiiy heath insurance.The funny thing is, just three months ago I was looking at buying health insurance when I had a job. These same companies were $210/month with a $1250 deductible for better coverage."
216,"I don't quite have time to dissect the full clip, but here is the start of some things.Premiums and variability: [1] (http://www.acscan.org/pdf/healthcare/implementation/background/NewFederalRatingRules.pdf). Generally, the remaining acceptable factors for premium variation are tobacco use, age, and geographic location. The big ones that are no longer applicable are pre-existing conditions and gender. Communism: I don't know what you're trying to articulate, but this is how I think about it.1) First, the realm of what can be ""factually"" discussed. Communism actually has a theoretical definition. The most famous definition is from Marx in his various writings, most notably the *Communist Manifesto*. Communism is the telos, or end, of Marx's conception of history. It is a society where the means of production are collectively controlled, and everyone lives in a utopia where they work only hard enough to survive and otherwise spend all their time creating things (because of what Marx calls our species-being). But that's not really important because the use of the word is meant to pejorative and evocative rather than precise. So if you care about precision then the comparison is misleading.2) Otherwise there are the more political arguments. The better term for the IM is probably socialist. There are two problems here. A) We have no idea what his definition of socialism is, so you have to force him to provide a definition. Then you can determine whether or not it actually applies. B) Having proven that, or granting the comparison, you then have an argument about why socialism is bad. Unless he's got some novel thoughts, usually the argument is from analogy. There are things that are American (good) and things that are un-American (bad). America is capitalistic, liberal (in the classical sense), laissez-faire, etc. Socialism is opposed to or in tension with capitalism. Ergo, Socialism is un-American, and therefore bad. Reasonable people can disagree about what exactly America is defined as, whether the un-American is bad, and whether Socialism and Capitalism are diametrically opposed.[Dave Ramsey Can't Do Math](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRSoCDVp3Q8)>He, like all opponents of obamacare/ACA are fixating on the front end, but ignore the latent benefits of having a larger risk pool.And this is the very crux of the matter - Ramsey fails to delineate for the listening audience that we are not solely adding sick people to a closed system, but also add healthy people as well which allows for that actuarial table/risk pool to be much larger, which dampens any premium increase their might be.I too have a great respect for Dave and his principles, he helped my family get out of debt and stay out of debt, and I owe some of my success to his teachings.  Yet, he has done a great disservice to his listeners and his own reputation by playing a purely political game over an issue that greatly affects the welfare of many in this country.A friend posted this on FB claiming it was non-partisan and unbiased. Here's my comment to her:Dave's bias is against the ACA. He shows this bias by only presenting one aspect of the law and how that aspect would negatively effect us as if it were the ONLY aspect of the law. He doesn't mention the individual mandate which requires that individuals must carry health insurance. The two main results of the mandate are: 1) people cannot purchase health insurance only when they get sick, and 2) the size of the ""pool"" is increased tremendously.The first part is a concession to the insurance companies who are now burdened with NOT being able to refuse people based on pre-existing conditions. The second part essentially reduces insurance costs for people already paying by getting more people paying into the system which spreads the cost around. Sounds a little socialist right? Except that's just how insurance works.It's fair to think that the individual mandate is government overstepping their bounds until you consider that for close to 30 years emergency rooms have been required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. When hospitals ""eat"" those costs, they pass them on to those of us who do pay. Therefore, people who have been going without insurance are not only gambling that they will not need it, they are playing with ""house money"" - our money.There is, of course, much more to the ACA, some of which I'm sure you've probably heard. Here's a really detailed list of the various provisions:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisions_of_the_Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_ActHe's just pandering. He brings up the 46% stat, as though federal income tax is the only form of government revenue. He throws out the word communism. He says the word ""math"" a lot without doing any actual math. He states that the government shutdown is going to last a lot longer. Target audience satisfied.Also, he specifically mentions that smokers won't get charged more. But there's a provision that allows them to be charged up to 50% extra (varies state-to-state). So he has at least one direct lie in there. Most of everything else is just rambling, not exactly verifiable.I did not disect the entire video. But the first problem I see right away is that he assumes (in his ""math"") that there will be no healthy people that did not have health insurance before, that will now be required to be on healthcare.He bases his entire opening planting the idea that this is only bringing on all the sick people and will cause all ""us"" healthy people who have health insurance to have to pay more.I would not go as far to say he is wrong, but he is oversimplifying the facts and leaving out the pieces that would contradict what he is trying to convey.After I get off work I will gladly dissect this clip. I know a lot of people who idolize Ramsey and if he's calling the mandate communism I will happily put his claims in their place.> He ignores the benefits of having these high risk individuals insured over the long term. Now, they go to the ER, don't pay the bill, and the rest of us pay for it in the back end. The ACA affords them primary care and the means to more effectively manage their conditions.But... they can still not buy insurance, go to the ER, shirk the bill, and we still pay for it, right?"
217,"> Crippling hyperinflation, devastating austerity, and, ultimately, mass murder of the nation's most vulnerable citizens.I must have missed something, because I don't remember any of that happening.Well, like all good lies, it starts from a place of truth. In this case, it's the fact that a group of CEOs from major banks met with Obama the afternoon of October 2nd. Note, however, that this becomes ""Wall Street"" in the text you provide - as if the whole of the finance industry is one juggernaut that speaks and acts as a cohesive whole. One of the first signs of a conspiracy theorist is when they simplify hugely complex and intricate interactions and institutions comprised of hundreds of thousands of businesses and individuals into a monolithic entity, such as this example. ""Wall Street"" is a concept, not an organization. They do not speak as a whole, but rather merely band together when their interests align.The CEOs discussed the possible default and the absolutely disastrous consequences it would have on the US economic system, the value of the dollar, and the global market as a whole. That was their conversation, not further bailouts or issues with regulation.[Source](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/02/news/economy/obama-wall-street-ceo/index.html).Once I hear the name LaRouche, it loses all credibility. These people hound representatives and senators almost non-stop for silly things. For example, my father worked for a Congressman (not going to reveal exactly when, for whom, or what position) and invited them in once so that he could try to get them to stop calling. Listened to them for five minutes, and then compared Obama to Hitler. Out the door they went and didn't call for at least a week.TL;DR They're lunatics who shouldn't be listened to.Edit: switched you to I in the first sentence.""more hyperinflation""This assumes hyperinflation has occurred and that more is on the way.I can prove this false with one link:http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/Inflation over the last few years has been steadily average or low; far from an abnormality to constitute calling it ""hyper"".

218,"I think that that is one of the legal issues we currently face for which there is no precedent, which is why it has been referred to by some as a ""Constitutional crisis.""  On the one hand, the President is required to spend money on laws authorized by Congress, and on the other hand, he may or may not be legally required to adhere to the debt ceiling (which is another law).  But the Constitution says effectively that ""the full faith and credit of the U.S. shall not be questioned"" (might be paraphrasing rather than exactly quoting).  This is a catch-22 when it comes to the present day problem; one way or the other, it may be literally impossible to avoid breaking the law.  In cases where two legal mandates conflict, it'll ultimately end up coming down to 1) what does he decide to do and 2) what do the Courts (or Congress) decide about his action in relation to existing law.I don't think anybody knows exactly how the scenario will play out, but in any case, there is no precedent for such a thing that I know of, and therefore no real way to do a fact check on this one that I can think of.

EDIT: This photo show a little different view of the Lincoln Memorial.http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lincoln-Memorial-1995.jpgBoth the shutdowns in 1995-96 happened [later in the year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_1995–96), which may have had some impact. There simply aren't as many tourists at outdoor monuments in December and January.I've been asking the same question. I'm old enough to remember the previous shut down and I do not **remember** them closing but... hell, I forget my keys at least once a week so...I've been doing some searching but newspapers don't have web archives that go that far back, so I'm left with a 2013 congressional report that cites a news article I can't find online and says that the NPS turned away 2 million visitors during the 95-96 shutdown: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34680.pdf but that doesn't mean that they were barricading open air monuments or local cycling trails.Yeah in 95 I didnt worry about bringing a pocket knife on a plane either, does not mean I can do that now. Times have changed.I was an adult then.I don't remember signs but I planned to go camping at a Federal park and it was closed when I got there.

220,"What facts are you wanting checked?  There are many factual claims made overtly in this quote and more implied by the context of the article.  The central questions seem to be a) whether refraining from raising the debt limit this month will cause the U.S. to default on its debt; and b) what will happen if it does.  I don't have a complete answer to either question, but I would suggest the Congressional Budget Office as a starting point.  In a [report published June 11, 2013](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44324) (PDF of the full report is available in the link), the CBO included this question and answer:>When Are the Extraordinary Measures Expected to Run Out, and What Will Happen If the Debt Ceiling Is Not Raised After They Are Exhausted?>>In the coming months, the Treasury will employ its full arsenal of extraordinary measures to stay under the current debt limit. If a new debt limit is not agreed upon, CBO expects those measures to run out sometime in October or November of this year.>>If the debt limit is not increased before extraordinary measures are exhausted, the Treasury will not be authorized to issue additional debt that increases the amount outstanding. (It will be able to issue additional debt only in amounts equal to maturing debt.) That restriction would severely strain the Treasury’s ability to manage its cash and could lead to delays of payments for government activities and possibly a default on the government’s debt obligations. Which of the government’s various financial obligations would be paid and which would not would be determined by the Administration.Alright lets see if I can offer some actual fact checking:>It really is irresponsible of the president to try to scare the marketsObama said:  “I think this time’s different,” of the current shutdown and impasse. “I think they should be concerned.”[Source](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/02/20788607-obama-exasperated-over-government-shutdown-warns-were-in-trouble?lite)(The market responded with a 160 point drop yesterday)[http://daytradingstockblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/dow-jones-close-10813-stock-market.html]So, while I can't prove 100% causality.  I feel comfortable saying that Obama's comments may have scared the market (and the amount of market activity today seems to confirm that).  lets call this confirmed:   > If you don’t raise your debt ceiling, all you’re saying is, ‘We’re going to be balancing our budget.’This one is much more difficult, in 2011 we were faced with this issue as well.  This is what The Atlantic posted would likely happen:* We pay out debt, miltiary payroll, VA benefits, and Social Security* S&P downgrade our bonds.  Fitch and Moody won't unless we actually default.* this will actually have less impact on markets than people are predicting, because most contracts and regulations that require institutions to buy AAA rated securities do not force those institutions to sell unless two out of three of the agencies have downgraded.  As long as Fitch and Moody's hold the line, we won't see the absolute chaos that would follow a downgrade of the US short-term credit rating from all three.* In the aftermath, we will, over the long term, pay more to borrow money. At least some of that is going to be paid for with higher taxes.[Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/07/what-happens-if-we-dont-raise-the-debt-ceiling/242728/)Nothing here seems to indicate that we will be balancing our budget-- but I can't exactly confirm or deny that.  Lets call that statement:  Unresolved.> ‘Oh my goodness, the world’s going to end’ — if we balance the budget, the world’s going to end? As stated about S&P will downgrade our bonds, but so long as Moodys and Fitch don't it isn't a HUGE deal.  However, if Moody's or Fitch does downgrade you'll see a huge sell off of bonds.  This is because ""most contracts and regulations that require institutions to buy AAA rated securities do not force those institutions to sell unless two out of three of the agencies have downgraded. "" This could impact up to 5 Trillion dollars in treasury backed securities [Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-07/a-u-s-default-seen-as-catastrophe-dwarfing-lehman-s-fall.html) I would say that I can confirm the world is not going to literally end but the sheer impact potential IS pretty staggering.Here's the Rand statement:“It really is irresponsible of the president to try to scare the markets,” said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. “If you don’t raise your debt ceiling, all you’re saying is, ‘We’re going to be balancing our budget.’ So if you put it in those terms, all these scary terms of, ‘Oh my goodness, the world’s going to end’ — if we balance the budget, the world’s going to end? Why don’t we spend what comes in?”“If you propose it that way,” he said of not raising the debt limit, “the American public will say that sounds like a pretty reasonable idea.” Here's a rebuttal:http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/10/04/20821805-rand-paul-has-a-debt-ceiling-plan?liteMuch of the debt is due to the interest on existing debt. http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htmEdit: source"

222,"Yes and No.  The South's economy depended heavily on slave labor, but that's only part of the story.  One of the big prime movers behind initial secession arguments were the idea of industrial tariffs.  The North would benefit from tariffs to protect its industries; the South, as a net-importer of industrial goods, would suffer.  Lincoln, and the Republican Party in general, were pro-tariff.  So I suppose you could argue that the civil war, by preventing secession (and therefor the escape from tariffs), did harm the Southern economy.  But more generally, the relative importance of (and profit from industry) has boomed at the expense of agriculture, and that would have happened regardless of the war.You could almost argue that the Civil War actually helped the South economically, since the establishment of industrial tariffs gave strong economic incentive to begin some manufacturing activities.  Since the trend towards industrialization was inevitable, delaying it longer could have hurt the South more than any short-term pain from tariffs might have.  Manufacturing is still much stronger in the North, but imagine the disparity if the South had been able to live in long-term economic delusion even a few decades longer.I really wanted to hear a detailed answer to this question.

They can't go unguarded and with no money to pay the rangers and guards they've had to be barricaded in the hope that nobody will vandalize them.The Army memorial, however, isn't a likely target, doesn't get much attention (right or wrong), and stands a much smaller chance of being vandalized.  Further, the Ellipse is guarded by Secret Service, who are essential personnel, and they can keep an eye on that one since it's mere feet from a checkpoint.The idea that Obama has any personal input over the security (or lack thereof) that individual memorials are getting is laughable *at best*."
224,">Know wonder why just a few weeks ago this President got rid of the Propaganda Laws.This is probably referring to the Smith-Mundt act or US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. -[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith-Mundt_Act).2013's NDAA had a provision that got rid of the ban on domestic propaganda operations, and it is true that Obama signed it into law.  however, it is disingenuous to say ""he"" did it, as he never publicly declared any support for that particular revision (at least that I've heard of) and the change to the law was attached to the bill that funds the military.  There was enough Congressional support to override any veto because it's a military funding bill, so it's more fair to say that Congress is responsible for this because it would be political suicide to try to veto that anyway.It's also worth noting that it affects the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the only major entity under their control that could be considered propaganda available domestically is Voice of America.  It is transparently a government organization anyhow, so it isn't as though most people are going to consume it unintentionally.  There may well be more to it that I'm not aware, but I think it's safe to say the FB post has only a small amount of truth and a lot of oversimplifying or outright lies.From my [ELI5 post](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx?context=5#c530lfx):>**Obamacare cuts $700 Billion dollars from Medicare!**: Not really. What the Affordable Care Act *actually* does is brings Medicare Advantage costs back in line with regular Medicare ( Citation: [Page 384, Sec. 3201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384) and [Page 389, Sec. 3202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=389) ), limit the growth of certain parts of Medicare where our spending is outpacing what we're actually required to spend  ( [Citation: Page 426, Sec. 3402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426) ), and replaces some parts of Medicare with better, more cost-effective substitutes ( [Citation: Page 361, Sec. 3112](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361) ). These accusations are based on a [report](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf) by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showing the reduction of Medicare costs from 2012-2022. However, the accusations fail to mention that those ""cuts"" will not result in reduced care, reduced enrollment, or reduced anything really, other than reduced costs to the taxpayers... which *both* Democrats and Republicans agree is a good idea (so much so that Republicans like Paul Ryan even included those exact same ""cuts"" in their own budget plans).>**Obamacare takes money from Medicare to pay for Obamacare!**: It absolutely does not. Every penny saved by changes the Affordable Care Act makes to Medicare goes *back* into Medicare. The bill itself specifically says that any of these savings must be used to increase Medicare solvency, improve its services, or reduce premiums ( [Citation: Page 481, Sec. 3601](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=481) ).I'll allow a bit more discussion on this, but unless someone comes up with some *strong* citations to support the claim being made in the OP, I will be labeling it as **False**.**Edit**: 4 Days later and I see no strong argument in support of this claim. Labeling it as ""False"".The ACA saves Medicare and Medicaid 718 billion dollars over a period of time. Thus it can be cut from the Medicare/Medicaid budget. The states are on the hook if they accepted the governments offer to pay 95% which gradually transitions to states taking a higher %. If the states agreed the minimum income requirement was raised from state set to the poverty level. (Georgia for example didn't accept and you must make less than 8800 a year instead of the 14990 the gov set) In terms of the propaganda laws. The president has no power in voiding a law, he can veto but not void. Only congress and the Supreme Court can change/rule invalid. Not to mention as a nation we are forbidden from having such laws by the first amendment with a history of precedence.The one and only response you need to this kind of claim:*Citation needed.> ""Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.""— Mark Twain[removed]I continued the conversation further with him. Let me know if you want to join in with me debating him. I will post screens. He makes a lot of oversimplified claims."
225,"Let's all take a second to practice our reading comprehension. The article is making the following claim:If you were uninsured, it was once predicted that you would have to pay X for insurance under Obamacare. Now that the market is actually pricing this insurance, we find that 95% of those people *who were previously uninsured* are paying less than X. In fact, the article claims 16% less on average.This article title (and related content) is not saying *anything* about the costs to those that were already insured.The article claims that 95 percent of people will find that Obamacare will cost less than the government claimed in the past that Obamacare would cost.People receiving their notices for private health insurance renewals this month are seeing their premiums going up 60% to 200%, because of changes to the plans required by Obamacare.The facts in the article may be accurate, but the title is not. 95% of Americans is not the same as 95% of uninsured Americans. They change the premise, which is intentionally and blatantly misleading.My rates have gone up, my buddy who sells insurance to companies posted something to facebook the other day about customers he has had for years had their premiums raised by 48 and 39% respectively due to ACA provisions.  I know a couple of anecdotes aren't indicative of larger statistics but any individual numbers I've come across seem to be increases and people complaining. Coupled with potentially large subsidies (anyone within 400% of poverty receives a subsidy) this could get out of hand quickly.  If there are 27 million households or almost 50 million individuals on food stamps which indicates poverty level income-- at least that many people will receive subsidies. So the cost to the government/taxpayers are going up and most people above poverty level income are seeing their premiums go up.This article and the report cited make a lot of claims.  Can we narrow it down a little?  Either that or the answer to your question is ""Some of the claims are true and all estimates are off""  Does Obamacare cost less than the free emergency room visit?"
226,"Okay, first: UPS and U of V are cutting health coverage for the employees' spouses who can get coverage elsewhere (like through their own employers). I'm not saying it's good or bad, but it's an important distinction.Second, Cleveland Clinic is not cutting costs because of Obamacare, though the story has been framed that way by some sloppy-minded individuals. [here's an article about it](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/obamacare-isnt-really-taking-your-jobs-cleveland-clinic-edition/279834/)Third, SeaWorld is hardly emblematic of anything, though they, like a number of other companies, are likely trying to slip under the impending coverage requirement.Lastly, Obamacare is a big change to the healthcare system in the US. Of course there are going to be big changes to businesses in the US. Will that mean a net positive or negative? Who knows. If some people get health insurance while some others get fewer hours, is it worthwhile?I recently went to visit some friends in the south who are still in the service industry and the businesses are ensuring that no one, besides managers, are working at 40+ hours a week to avoid this.It may be that some are, it may be bollocks, it probably is very complicated.But here's what to keep in mind before digging into *any* of the details: A business (or its owner(s)) will make a variety of business decisions for a variety of reasons. They often will disclose some of these decisions publicly (and by publicly I am including to the employees) but will rarely disclose the *actual* reasons. The reasons given will always be ones that will try to maximize the way a bunch of parties look, including making themselves look good, their competitors bad, and their enemies worse. If someone blames the ACA, assume that the ACA *might have* played *some* part in the decision, but was, at most, only a fraction of it and may not have been part of the decision process at all.I  know trader Joe's dropped healthcare for all of its part time workers.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/11/trader-joes-obamacare_n_3902341.html""Because"" = impossible to know for sure.Keep in mind that people who are not eligible for coverage via their workplace will be able to enter the state exchanges, where their premiums will be immediately offset by subsidies.Because a lot of people not eligible through their work tend to be poorer, they may very likely end up with *better* insurance for *less* (or even *no*) money through the exchanges + subsidies.And keep in mind that just about everyone agrees that de-coupling health insurance from employment is a good thing in the long run....So, even if it is true that businesses are dropping coverage, it's not automatically a bad thing.[removed]"
227,"[FY 2009 Budget Message of the President,George W Bush, dtd 4 feb 08](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2009-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2009-BUD-4.pdf)The FY 2009 budget was crafted under Bush. The government fiscal year runs October 1 to September 30. So currently, FY 2013 covers 10/01/12 - 09/30/13. FY 2009 would have been from 10/01/08 to 09/30/09. Been that way since about 1974-76. I forget exactly when.Right from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_States_federal_budget):> The United States federal budget for fiscal year 2009 began as a spending request submitted by President George W. Bush to the 110th Congress. The final resolution was approved by the House on June 5, 2008. The final spending bills for the budget were not signed into law until March 11, 2009 by President Barack Obama, nearly five and a half months after the fiscal year began.George W. Bush was president for 4 months of FY 2009.  Barack H. Obama was president for 8 months of FY 2009.Again from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama#Economic_policy):> On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package.> Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry in March 2009,>  Obama signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as ""Cash for Clunkers"", that temporarily boosted the economy.I don't recall a stimulus, car company bailouts, and cash for clunkers in Bush's FY 2009 budget proposal.Obama and the Democratic Congress played a major role in increasing government spending in FY 2009.  The 110th Congress' budget for 2009 totaled $3.1 trillion.Decreased tax revenue and **high spending** resulted in an unusually large FY 2009 budget deficit of about $1.4 trillion, well above the $407 billion projected in the FY 2009 budget.To be fair, Bush did have a Democrat controlled Congress to compromise with at that time.  And Clinton had a Republican Congress.  Still, budgets reflect on both parties.Lets say Obama is totally responsible for the 2009 budget.  And why does that matter?  It could be a $100T deficit for a single year and it still doesn't mean anything without other information.  Was the money spent effectively?  Before you answer that, was the $1T spent in Iraq effective to solve whatever problem that was?  Halliburton thinks so."
228,"It depends on how you assess the organization.  You cannot definitively say that his statement is false.“The Afghan war is coming to an end. Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self. Groups like AQAP [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States.”-Barack Obama, July 2013What he doesn't mention is that AQAP is not really just a ""collection of thugs"": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_the_Arabian_PeninsulaHe doesn't mention AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) either: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/26/key-mali-lawmaker-challenges-obama-on-al-qaida-thr/?page=all And then, there's the recent jailbreak fiascos:http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-asserts-responsibility-for-iraqi-prison-breaks.html?_r=0(tl;dr - “We are concerned about the increased tempo and sophistication of Al Qaeda operations in Iraq,” said a senior State Department official)Basically, the various splinters continue to have influence and change their methodologies, becoming more organized and therefore more financed.  As they have done so, they have begun to outshine the original AQ, even though they are nominally ""underneath"" it.The smart ones survived our tactics, then adapted to outmaneuver them.  Now they gain strength and attack foreign forces in secure areas that we've stood up.  Might not be long before they're directly attacking our own secure installations again, which sounds suspiciously like fearmongering to someone who's been watching the news for the last ten years.Disagreements?Just ran across this. It came out today:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323420604578648482570494670.htmlIt is likely too difficult to say anything for certain though.Peter King* not Kine, is on the HI committee. This means he has more access than anyone in the nation to the programs and analysis that is done for CT. There isn't a better source than someone on the HIC (and I don't trust Republicans but he's probably correct on this).AQ of course adapted and learned since 2001. They have been fighting a war for up to 22+ years now. The ones who survive become better at training. When you look at the frequency of ""attempts"", it has increased significantly.Hmm, kinda figured AQ would have switched to sending ravens after the whole snowden thing. Kinda weird that they would still be using the same old communication methods that they should now know are being watched.King has a history of saying things which are unverifiable and also supported the IRA when it was still tied to terrorism.  It's possible he has access to some kind of intelligence but none of that has come to light or been verified.The only known anti-terrorist action taken in the past 2 weeks besides a higher state of alert was a drone strike in Yemen which also caused civilian casualties.  So, make of that what you will.Because we've bombed the shit out of innocent civilians turning more to anti US causes? Anything I hear about terrorism from elected officials always seems like there's a whole other angle playing in the background. We have not thwarted major terror attacks because of the billlllllions of dollars we spent on homeland security.. They created and inflated this monster.. cut the shit feds."
229,"It's hard to fact-check a claim when you're not even really sure what the claim being made is. Is the author of this article (image, whatever) saying, for example, that gun control laws nullify the freedoms guaranteed by the second amendment? Are they saying that gun control laws are unconstitutional? And which gun control laws?That's *one* of the ""claims"" made by this photo. This is hardly a presentation of purported facts. Even as opinion it falls short because it's not especially clear what that said opinion is, other than that there's some sort of conflict between these policies and the Bill of Rights, but exactly what the nature of that conflict is supposed to be is vague. You might as well ask people to fact-check a political cartoon.It's not that the material presented is wrong or false, but that it's not clearly presenting a checkable claim.The allegations about Article III are completely false, as are those against Article X.Article III *specifically* references forcing people to allow soldiers to sleep in their homes. Honestly, I can't find a single instance of this happening in the U.S. since the Civil War.The stamp about ""Federal Supremacy"" is actually the worst of the lot. [Article VI, Clause 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause)  of the Contitution *explicitly states* that the Federal government has authority (see supremacy) over the states; thus any whining about ""States' Rights"" is just a dog-whistle to modern-day Confederates to rally to the anti-government cause.I'd say its inaccurate, most of the red stamps were challenges to the amendments but theres a level of common sense missing imho the bill of rights guarantees you have rights but it doesn't say those rights cant have practical restrictions/rules. The easiest example of this is gun control and occupyOccupy never seemed to understand that if you interrupt somebody else's day then you're are no longer using your right to free speech. They would get in trouble blocking pathways or streets and then wonder why they were getting arrested.Dude you got it from /r/occupywallstreet why are you shocked?"
230,"The only thing I can find as far as the health care cost point is that [2014 will be much slower growth in costs compared to recent years](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/18/pf/healthcare-costs/index.html). I can't find anything about the last 50 years, but I would think the last 30 years to be right or close to it, as I can't find anything saying health care costs where anywhere near inflation rates (I may be wrong, but again I can't really find the data here).As far as the deficit, I don't even have to look that up. He is talking about dollar to dollar comparison, not percentage of GDP. [Graph of deficit as a % of GDP](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/spending_chart_1900_2016USp_14s1li011lcn_G0f_Annual_Federal_Deficit/). So his claim is correct in that we have cut almost $600 billion out of deficit, but before 2009 we never even had a $600 billion deficit, so the correct comparison would be the failing at the fastest rate since 1999, as that is a comparison of percentage of GDP.Edit: Also I should note when I say that health care costs weren't near inflation, I mean it was usually much higher than inflation. I figure it would be obvious, but just stating to clarify.Edit 2: After looking at that graph about deficits, he is actually right as a percentage of GDP also, we went from 10% to around 2%, or an 8% decline, which is actually the greatest decline since the end of WWII. So he is actually right on all accounts. My bad I looked at the graph in correct. In 1992-2000, we went from only 5% to -2% or 7% change. So he is right.Is there a source on this?Fastest Falling Deficit - True.http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/25/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-falling-fastest-rate-60-years/""The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years.""""Growth in health care spending is indeed at its lowest level since we started keeping track in the 1960s. The president made a more accurate claim than Rep. Nancy Pelosi did in May, when she said Obamacare was bringing down health care costs. Spending is up. Growth in spending is down. And it’s not yet entirely clear why, though some health economists calculate it’s more than just the recent economic downturn.http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/jul/24/four-familiar-facts-barack-obamas-speech/There doesn't seem much dissent on this one, nor has there been much activity lately, so I'm going to go ahead and mark this as ""confirmed"", albeit with a note.That note is this: The quote in question states two facts, but it deserves mention that the quote itself does not have Obama taking credit for these facts. If it had, it would merit a ""Mostly True"", as there are numerous factors that *could* be responsible for these facts, not the least of which is the struggling economy slowing growth in health care costs and Congressional gridlock slowing down national spending.The facts, as they were stated, are true. Any conclusions one might draw from those facts, however, are more difficult to ascertain.100% true, thanks Obama!"
231,"[Citation Needed]Given that at least some of the information your claim asserts is undoubtedly classified, I'm leaning towards marking this as ""unverifiable"". Just because some contractors helped to compose these lists doesn't mean that they were *all* ""developed, maintained, and completely run by private corporations"", but it doesn't mean they weren't, either.Unless anyone brings anything new to this conversation any time soon, I'll be marking it as ""unverifiable"".The government outsources everything to private companies, as private companies are more efficient and can get it done cheaper. This is why they started replacing cooks in the dfac on military bases with civilian cooks and shit in recent years. Would not surprise me if this were true."
232,"They will not seek a warrant (and so not search) a reporter's material in order to find out about a third party.

The same part from Reuters says:>In the future, the Justice Department would not seek warrants in relation to reporters ""if the sole purpose is the investigation of a person other than the member of the news media,"" the report said.In other words, they won't be seeking warrants to search through reporters files if they're investigating someone who isn't a member of the news media.http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/12/us-usa-justice-warrant-media-idUSBRE96B0RC20130712"
233,"There's definitely no evidence it's true. It really just seems like convenient conjecture.Out of curiosity, wouldn't the movement of these ""WMD's"" from Iraq to Syria have been easily noticed? Wouldn't there also be intel trails leading to such?  If not, how are we able to link them now?  Here is a news [article](http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/071912-618875-syria-chemical-weapons-came-from-iraq-.htm?p=full) that is ""pro-Iraqi Connection""  Here is a news [article](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/07/syria-iraq-wmd-meme/) that provides a logical stance against the claim.One need only look at Iraq-Syria relations to know that this is bullshit. Syria allied with the coalition in the first Gulf War, and the countries have been at odds for decades.Not sure if this is true or not, but when I was in the army this was always the narrative since the very beginning, that the WMD's were smuggled into Syria early on hence why they were not found. So this appears to validate it somewhat but I don't know that we could actually make that connection at this point.I'm almost certain that this is veritably false since there were no WMDs to go missing.This is another of those chain-forwardedTeaBagger fantasies.It's a lot cheaper for some right-wing social media outfit to produce ""Grouchy Grandpa"" e-mail forwards/memes and scatter them across the Internet for redistribution than it is to do the real and hard political work of building and maintaining a society.There were no WMDs in Iraq. If they had any of these they would have used them against the US forces. Why would a dictator want to get caught and prosecuted and not use chemical weapons?Nice try.  Shia' vs Sunni.  WMDs are dangerous things.  I would think they are either technologically tricky or very tedious and exacting, very big and technical or small and involves detailed thinking.  Just seems like a stretch to me."

235,"[Here's the Google Search, which the OP suggested.](https://www.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&q=%22health+insurance+costs+set+for+a+jolt%22)Edit: Fixed!The article uses as a baseline comparison a $63/month plan with a $5000 deductible.  It compares that to the basic Bronze plan around $200/month, which purports to cover 60% of medical costs.  This is not really a fair comparison without knowing a) the deductible of the new plan, b) the relative availability of care under each plan, and c) what the minimum coverage requirements are under ObamaCare.Anecdotal evidence, but the premium for my family doubled in January, and the deductible tripled, for less coverage. My husband works for sears.Ours has actually dropped significantly with Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  The deductible went up a bit.  Hope others had good fortune.The tradeoff of Obamacare is supposed to be neutral if not better.  Insurance companies agreed to cover certain things like pre-existing conditions and dependents under 26 years old in exchange for 30+ million people being compelled to become their customers.  The net effect is supposed to be zero.Note that the NET effect is zero.  This means for some it will go up, for others it will go down.  If you have a pre-existing condition, your insurance will drop a lot.  If you are young and healthy, your insurance will potentially go from $0 to $300.  This is how insurance works.As a side note, please, Please, PLEASE be wary of any article that does not contain links to information sources.  Without citations, any article like this is not much more than an opinion piece.  I would encourage you to Google some of the exerts quoted in the article.  It is not pretty.http://www.coveredca.com/calculating_the_cost.htmlThat is the estimated cost for CA residents next year. Currently we pay close to $500 a month for just my wife to have insurance. I am a disabled veteran and due to the current cost I only use the VA, not to mention that previous insurance would not cover any of my injuries from when I was serving. We are not talking a huge amount, I am only rated at 10%.However it is estimated to be $380 for both of us starting in 2014. So it will become less expensive and will cover both of us. Any argument of it skyrocketing is because it helps the GOP from everything I have seen. If you do everything to try and make something fail, it has a much higher possibility of that happening.The WSJ is owned by Rupert Murdoch and the reason why I have the site blocked.  If you want to see how it is working, check Massachusetts, Hawaii, and soon to be California.  There ya go.Based on all the anti-Murdoch posts and lack of any substantive critiques, I'd say there's a good chance this story is accurate.I suppose the irony of being subscribed to /r/politics while ripping on Murdoch's agenda is completely lost to them.this study was just published by a respected third party. the brookings institution published similar results last month. it amazes me how far the republicans will go to sabotage this program. not because it's bad for the country. they actually agree with most of what the program does. they just will not give health care to the 30 million uncovered americans who would receive coverage when it's implemented. oh, yeah. and it's got obama's name on it.http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/an-early-look-at-premiums-and-insurer-participation-in-health-insurance-marketplaces-2014/just an add on to my last post. i mentioned the brookings institution and wanted to post a lnk to their website. they are non-partisan and maybe the most respected and influential think tank on the planet. in this article they say that the only thing that could keep obamacare from working is republican sabotage. read the entire article here. http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2013/08/07-health-care-reform-aca-aaronI don't think the conclusion is reasonable, and is probably impossible to tell at this early date. I think it will be hard to tell what the future will look like, when you compare the current trends in insurance premiums against health exchanges which have not been fully implemented yet.Two to three times? That smells a bit bias-y to me.I know mine is going up."

The case involved someone who hadn't been arrested at that point.2. Later, at trial, the police reported that when they asked the person who owned the gun (IIRC) the person stopped answering questions. #2 is the key point - was it wrong to tell the jury that the person stopped answering questions?

240,"If there is I assume the Daily Show has direct access to it.http://capitolwords.org/[On the Issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm) seems to be a nice website to keep track of what pols say, don't know how often they update, though.There are a few private databases that collect mainstream media transcripts.  Lexis-Nexis, CQ Researcher, etc. that transcript congressional records/speeches and the main news channels.  Videos are more tricky - and less useful for initial research - because they take more time to view and require more legal infrastructure to set up as you'd have to set up an agreement with CSPAN, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, PBS, etc. to catch all of the most relevant interviews.Public databases are a bit more tricky and very time-consuming.  You could use Library of Congress for access to the congressional record, search for archived press releases on the politician's site, and look for the specific interview on the networks' website.  Depending on how old the source is, and how good the website is, it may or may not still be hosted.Yes thanks, be easy to bring up the horseshit that they've said and hold them to account.

242,"For a recent study, see the KFF 2012 numbers here (warning PDF):  http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7451-08.pdfThis would indicate that your friend's statistic is misleading at best.  The conclusion from this well-documented study is that the majority of uninsured Americans are working poor or in poverty.  Also, the majority (over 80%)are citizens or legal residents.Your friend could make the case that the poor Americans living near or under the poverty line are ""choosing to opt out"" of private insurance, but that strains credulity.According to this Census report (see page 21 at http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p60-243.pdf), as of 2011, approximately 9.75 million people without health insurance are not US citizens. Thus, in order to come up with the numbers your friend suggested, there would need to be about 32 million people opting out willingly. Can anyone else get a number similar to that?I love the idea that people opt out willingly.  Maybe it's jsut me but I have yet to meet the person who can afford health insurance but who's like, ""Nah.  I'm gonna go without.""Well if your friend is  the one making the claim, (which he is),  then he needs to provide the evidence backing up his claim. The  burden of proof is upon him. Its not your job to prove or disprove his claim, It's his job. Until he can provide reputable evidence for his claim he's just making stuff up. Look at what happens in Courtroom. The prosecution makes a claim that you committed a certain crime. The burden is upon them to use evidence to prove their claim beyond a reasonable doubt. If they cannot provide evidence to support their claim beyond a reasonable doubt then their claim is dismissed for a lack of evidence.Texas has at least 5.4 million people uninsured.So where exactly is he able to make his claim that [Texas](http://tcdd.texas.gov/texas-still-has-most-uninsured-map-shows-uninsured-by-county/) is filled with ""illegals"" when they can't afford coverage or lost it along with their jobs?You friend may be correct, however the larger question is does it really matter?

243,"Per your second link, the groups included ""Earth Justice, the Pew Charitable Trust and the Natural Resources Defense Council"".

IOW, we ain't exactly talking Earth First here.  These organizations are ""extremist"" only if you are the sort of person who thinks that *any* form of environmentalism is extremism.After some rooting around, I was able to find [this response](http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jdevine/seeking_industrial_livestock_i.html) to the allegations on the NRDC's website.  Excerpting a couple of relevant-seeming paragraphs:>Over a period of several months, NRDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts have successfully pressed EPA for information it has collected on a major source of water pollution –large livestock operations, often known as factory farms or concentrated animal feeding operations (or “CAFOs”).  The information was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.>In response to the disclosure of the public information, The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association issued a statement attacking the disclosure, labeling our groups as “extremists,” and claiming that making the information public would pose a threat to the safety of CAFO operations.[snip]> The most irresponsible charge made by NCBA is that providing this information to public interest groups somehow may facilitate criminal acts against facilities; that accusation is entirely unwarranted. NRDC and Pew condemn such illegal activities and reject the notion that transparency will encourage them.  In fact, the location of many livestock operations is already public information, which undermines the industry’s suggestion that providing information to the public about other facilities creates security risks. Several state governments already offer data about CAFOs, including their locations, on their websites. For example, both North Carolina and Missouri have facility information online.  Likewise, aerial imagery that includes industrial livestock operations can be easily found on map-based websites.  Keeping information about additional sites under wraps undermines good faith efforts to understand the industry and its waste handling practices."
244,"just by reading that, they count FDIC as a part of those subsidies. Every bank has FDIC, even the local Co-op that I use. While I think it's a part of the picture, the fact that every bank has it doesn't necessarily give bigger banks a competitive advantage.No. They got $780 billion in 2008 because of the TARP bailout. It is ABSOLUTELY NOT a yearly subsidy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_ProgramAlso, as kiki_strumm3r notes, FDIC is included. However, FDIC is an insurance policy for banks. The bank receives no money from the FDIC except in case of theft or loss due to disaster/emergency. That insurance is on YOUR deposits, not the full value that the bank holds. It is an insurance policy for the customer, not the bank. http://www.fdic.gov/about/mission/index.htmlSo, reading that right off the bat you should wonder: 780 billion per year would be more that 25% of the government's total income.http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2012USThat's more than they spend on the military:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_StatesIt's also many times the size of the farm subsidies:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_StatesSo, are they really ""subsidizing the banks with 780 billion per year""?

245,"I don't believe this can truly be fact-checked, because you can't assume that each item pirated equals a lost sale: I download plenty of things that I wouldn't otherwise buy, just because I'm curious or because I like it enough to listen to once, but would not entertain spending 16$ on it.  You could probably fact check specific stats on recording industry sales trends, and you could fact check some stats on piracy, but you can't fact-check a causal link between the two.  Additionally, for many artists, piracy may well improve their sales because it increases awareness, thereby increasing word-of-mouth promotion and concert sales, which eventually can in some cases lead to more purchases of RIAA-product.  It is also common for companies to raise prices and, in public, blame the increase on some other, easy scapegoat in order to quell public backlash.  I am not claiming that is what is happening, but it should be considered as part of the discussion around piracy.  Lost sales could very well be due to increased prices, rather than the other way around.EDIT - Some more stuff.They lose 4 billion of their *potential profit* (whatever they think that is).  So in reality, the industry is still finishing the year in the black and they aren't actually losing any moneyWhile I don't normally like TedTalks, I thought [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZadCj8O1-0) was pretty good in relation to this question. It does not refute the number (I believe the speaker attributes $8 billion per year i.e. all of the losses in revenue from the music industry since napster), but it does show how squishy these values really are.I think the numbers of downloaded songs is a poor indication of losses for the recording industry.  There are significant numbers of people who download for downloading's sake. These people download songs, then never listen to them. They would have never bought those songs even if they couldn't get them by downloading. So this is not a loss for the recording industry. I'm sure they do lose money from people not buying their product, but not to the extent the RIAA wishes to portray.I'm putting this as **false**.What the recording industry of America does is try to say that every last download of a song is a lost sale.Neil McBride, who is now a Solicitor General in the USG, came up with this while he was a VP for the [Business Software Alliance](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080718/1226541724.shtml)What every last study has shown is that piracy is indeed an innovation in the digital market.

Yeah the competition is much more fierce but the chance that a small artist has of making money in the industry seems to have increased rather than declined. It seems the only people who are making less money are the ones who had nothing to do with making the art.PROOFREAD Ninja!"
246,"The Army is suspending new applications to the tuition assistance program [due to sequestration cuts](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/03/08/army-suspends-tuition-assistance-program.html?comp=7000023317828&rank=1). There are three possible avenues for Obama's involvement.1) the sequester itself: it was put into place in the summer of 2011 as the result of negotiations between Obama and Boehner. I tend to give the responsibility more to Boehner as Boehner was the one pushing for solely spending cuts while Obama preferred including tax increases.2) not stopping the sequester: again, kind of an opinion question. Obama seemed to push harder for stopping the sequester while a sizable faction of Republicans embraced it. You can look at the same set of facts and conclude in the opposite direction if you are predisposed to blame Obama. ""There are no facts, only interpretations"" rings especially true in politics.3) the army's decision: technically speaking, as president, Obama has ultimate authority over all decisions made by bureaucratic agencies, including the army. However, I'm pretty sure that it would be unprecedented for him to step in on a line item in the Army's budget like this - the president's position as commander in chief really has only been used for overarching military doctrine.Personally, I'd say Obama heard about it at the same time we did. It's probably not standard procedure to consult the president on policy changes that don't change current military/battlefield operations - recruitment and compensation tend to get a pretty long leash.I think this is going to be almost impossible to fact check unless someone in the administration comes out and says they made that specific recommendation.But you should clarify for your friend on Facebook that this wouldn't affect the [G.I.

And nothing has been decided yet.May be a good topic to x-post to /r/politicaldiscussion I will take the other side from /u/josephgoreman 1) The sequester was a doomsday scenario put in place to force a plan for long term deficit reduction.  For the GOP, the threat was expiring ALL Bush era tax rates unless a compromise was reached. This was not a separate tax issue. It was specifically part of the sequestration package. Compromise was reached by extending some, but not all tax rates. If you want to argue it wasn't enough, thats fine, but the White House didn't have to sign off. They accepted the compromise on the revenue side of sequester.For the Dems, the threat was sweeping unilateral spending cuts unless a compromise was reached. Having accepted the compromise on revenue, debate on the spending side was extended so compromise could be reached without unilateral cuts. The Dems haven't offered a plan that doesn't include more tax increases. The GOP will not accept more tax increases since they feel that they have already compromised on the revenue side.2)  The Dems are now blaming the GOP for being inflexible even though they have yet to put forward a cuts only package."

I will be on the lookout, but I don't really see this being credible.However, when active duty I knew of people who weren't allowed to have access to military firearms for various reasons (depression, severe PTSD, criminal convictions while serving) and maybe this is an extension of that?  If they are receiving disability for PTSD or depression, maybe they would deem them unfit to have a weapon while collecting gov't money.Again, I haven't heard anything about this.EDIT:  Also, that blog is an atrocity.[Here is a source that makes a little more sense](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/03/veterans-gun-rights-defense-bill_n_2230786.html) (Although I'm not a huge fan of Huffpo, this particular story seems to present both sides of the issue.)*If* a veteran is deemed incompetent, then the VA may submit his/her name to the  Criminal Background Check System.

I've even asked my case handlers if this will affect my firearms ownership rights in the future; their answer was ""No, it will not be affected"".  Not ""Well, maybe"", not ""Kinda, sorta""... it was ""No, it will not be affected"".Yea as a Marine with many buddies that are already out I have heard of no such thing. I own and conceal carry along with many of the guys I know.HAhahaha... no. The VA has no power over you as a veteran beyond the power any hospital you go to has over you. They dictate nothing especially when it comes to constitutional rights. I am a vet and I have many family members who are vets and family members who work for the VA. The VA has a lot of problems giving timely help to veterans and they are under staffed but,  a Vet can walk into the hospital, admit he snorts cocaine, and still get free health care because he earned it. I see this as nothing but government healthcare type propaganda. I can actually research the listed Brady Handgun prevention crap but it isn't worth my time.Yes I realize I just provided nothing but anecdotal evidence but yea, I have gotten no letter.The article has now been updated to include a redacted copy of the letter.They are probably obliquely referring to 18 USC 922 (g), which says:"" It shall be unlawful for any person—[...](4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution;[...] to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.""It's not immediately clear to me that a VA determination that a veteran needs a representative payee to handle their finances has been ""adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution"". It's also not immediately clear to me that we want people who are experiencing symptoms of (potentially minor/treatable) mental illness to think that, by seeking VA treatment for that mental illness, they risk a lifetime firearms ban. See http://imgur.com/a/aUVq4 for the letter.Anybody who has been adjudicated as a mental defective should get letters prohibiting the ownership of firearms.  Even if true, the VA would just be informing the vet of the law."
249,"The Daily Caller has an article about this: http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/21/cantor-mistakes-1-2-million-nsf-grant-for-world-of-warcraft-study/One of the researchers at the university that received the grant said: ""We do in fact have $1.2 million dollar grant from NSF that examines what aspects or mechanisms are responsible for improvements in cognition due to playing digital games and funds our development of a game based on these findings.""According to the article, the research team did conduct a study using World of Warcraft, but it was a small, $4,500 study they used as a ""proof of concept,"" presumably to demonstrate that they intended to study something that was actually worthwhile.So yes, a $1.2 million grant went to fund research that involved video games, but the money didn't solely cover the costs of paying participants (I'm not even sure participants *were* paid, although it's possible).  I assume there's quite a bit of expensive equipment involved -- and some researchers to pay.Factcheck.org did a story on this. It began, ""House Speaker John Boehner tweets that the Obama administration is spending $1.2 million “paying people to play video games.” That’s misleading.

250,"Side question as a non-US observer...I understand minimum wage is not compulsory in US... so is this true? And if so, what happens to companies who don't pay it.Well, looking at the [Census](http://www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html) numbers, there around 40 million small business employees to 80 million non-small business companies as recently as 2008. I can't find hard evidence to point either way, but it would make sense to simply assume that on sheer volume alone, there is a better likelihood that large businesses employ a minimum wage worker. I think the other thing that can be considered, the big employers of minimum wage workers are typically chains. That's just the way it goes. Even at a higher level, larger corporations like Deloitte, KPMG, Lockheed Martin, and Accenture, salaries there are lower than small firms. So, it's not unreasonable to think that the vast majority of Walmart's 2.2 million or McDonald's half-a-million plus* employees in the US earn minimum wage. But again, it's all speculation. *- Couldn't find solid employment figures for McDonald's in the US, but 1.8 million employees/34000 stores globally is about 52 per store. 14,000 US stores x 52 = 712,000. Considering it's supply chain, I don't think it's too unreasonable an estimate.A similar claim I'd be interested in checking (should I post a separate fact check query for it?) is that most minimum wage earners are not trying to feed a family of four, but are teenagers on their first foray in the workforce.More importantly, is the small size of one's business an excuse to exploit the people who work there?I keep finding the same reference to 66% of minimum wage workers being employed by large companies, but that's generated from the National Employment Law Project, which isn't exactly non-partisan. You have to realize, though, that the two statements aren't necessarily in opposition. Even if most minimum wage workers work for large companies, it's possible that the increased salary burden from the minimum wage workers that they do employ would be detrimental to the health of small businesses. (I say ""possible"" since we're talking about a hypothetical impact and I haven't found any convincing evidence that it would or would not)One thing that should be considered is that many large companies contract work (like janitorial services and grounds-keeping) out to smaller companies who offer lower wages and few, if any, benefits, and are less likely to be strict about employing undocumented workers.Small businesses are companies that are privately owned. This means that technically Wal-Mart is a small businesses.  If you go by the legal definition of a small businesses then they do employ the majority of the american workforce.  If you go by the colloquial definition then small businesses employ a minority of the american workforce.I read somewhere that 66% of min wage workers worked for large corp's. , fast food really large corps. Actually Wal-Mart is a small business but that's just for the republicans so they can give Wal-Mart tax breaks & bitch about the Democrats screwing over small business.. I don't know if it's true or not. Seems more like 88%. PlutocratsLarge corporations are more effective at extracting value from unskilled labor.  Therefore, if you artificially raise the cost of unskilled labor, you prevent people who would have taken a lower wage at a local business (where they probably would have more flexibility, more control, more fringe benefits).  This in effect subsidizes large businesses, as well as the protection that it delivers to union workers with contracts tied to the minimum wage.

This puts the US at about even with the third world in terms of murder rates.  GBR looks more like a first world nation in terms of murder rates.http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#section_11You could argue that most violent crimes take place in more densely populated areas... the UK has a population density of 670 ppl/sq. mi. (Just England is like 1000) compared to the US with a pop density of 89 ppl/sq. mi.  It's not a fact that will refute the entire argument, but having to walk or drive for a couple miles just to find someone to commit a crime against helps in keeping violence down.  Also, things to consider: most violent crime in urban areas of the US goes unreported... not sure if the UK has a similar problem. Also, check into whether the two countries have different definitions for violent crime. If the UK has a broader spectrum of what falls into this category, then logically their number is higher.  I just remember that you can craft statistics to say whatever you want... so it is hard to use them in an argument.Have any merit** damn phonehttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196941/The-violent-country-Europe-Britain-worse-South-Africa-U-S.htmlLooks like this is where the figures come from.Britain's definition of violent crimes is much broader than America's. If you look at [gun homicides per 100,000 people](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html) then America has a much higher rate. An important note about this though is that it is mostly due to the higher-than-average gun homicides in major metropolitan areas with lots of gang violence (i.e. Chicago), which are done mostly with handguns, not assault weapons or rifles.Notice it's worded as ""violent crimes"", not ""crimes perpetrated with a firearm"".  Plus, it's just a picture.  An article with citations and supporting evidence would usually be a more credible source.The short answer is no, it doesn't have any merit to it.The long answer is that the UK and the US have different definitions for 'violent crime,' making the numbers more difficult to compare. Not only that but the numbers fail to take into account the severity of the incident. In the UK, a fistfight would be a 'violent crime,' which would count for the same as a murder or a stabbing.Channel 4 did a nice piece on these statistics on their Fact Checking blog, just [here.](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/gun-control-what-can-america-learn-from-britain/12466)http://www.nationmaster.com/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/CrimeUK has higher assault and rape. We have roughly twice the us levels of these crimes. However, I would rather be punched in the face and have my phone stolen than be shot by a criminal who dosnt want to risk reaction-time roulette.Britain is a far more violent country than the US, but that can be attributed to many things. I tend to think Hooliganism and how alcohol is inbedded in its culture.This number accounts for all violent crimes, not just gun related crimes. Per 100,000 people the UK has around .04 gun related deaths compared to the US's 3.6.Overall, I believe the numbers do still add up to more violent crimes in the US than Britain, but that's mostly due to the population size.You can find this information on the CDC and World Health Organization sites.It's true to a certain degree, but it's a difficult comparison.  If you look at the government's statistics from the UK and the United States...US: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/violent-crimeUK: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime/stb-focus-on--violent-crime-and-sexual-offences-2011-12.html#tab-Overall-violence-–-volume-and-comparisonThe pie chart from the UK website shows that more than half of what are deemed ""violent crimes"" in the UK are either robberies or result in an injury/wound (presumably to the victim or perpetrator?).Using the total number -- 762,515 offenses -- and the population of the United Kingdom (which is apparently 62,641,000), I'm getting a violent crime rate of roughly 1217 per 100,000 people.  (Total offenses divided by the population, multiplied by 100,000 -- but I'm still groggy, so it's entirely possible that's not the proper way of calculating the rate)  Even if you were to discount assaults that didn't have a physical injury or robbery involved, the number you get is higher than the number of violent crimes in the US.The 2,034 number appears to come from a crime study done by the EU Commission.  I did a quick search and didn't immediately find the actual report from the EU, but I did see infographs that cited that study and listed the various EU countries by their violent crime rates.  I did, however, find this article from the Telegraph: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5712573/UK-is-violent-crime-capital-of-Europe.htmlTheir summary of the report: ""It means there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the UK, making it the most violent place in Europe."" -- Which makes me think that the EU assumed all crimes are violent.  Obviously, the UK's government disagreed, since they found a lower rate.The FBI states a 403.6 violent crimes per 100,000 people rate, defining a violent crime as ""murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program as those offenses which involve force or threat of force.""  I can't be sure, as I only did a cursory run-through of these sources, but it seems to me that the FBI uses at least a somewhat more strict standard for what they categorize as a violent crime than the UK, but perhaps not significantly stricter.**tl;dr: Given the imperfect comparison, I'm inclined to say that the UK *does* have a higher rate of violent crimes, but *not* to the degree suggested by that image.**Also, it's important to keep in mind that if one were to assume a strong causal link between gun ownership and violent crimes, there's a serious tradeoff here: the United States has a high murder rate but comparatively low violent crime rate, while the United Kingdom has a low murder rate but a comparatively high violent crime rate.  Different beliefs on personal autonomy, individual freedoms, etc. will lead to differing opinions on which of these two options is preferable.If I've misinterpreted anything from those sources, *please* do reply and let me know so I can edit this post!  I don't intend to suggest I've done a completely thorough analysis of all the information out there.Comparing apples to oranges to prove you shouldn't ban kumquats.[deleted]"

Family without minimum essential coverage.  (i) In 2016, Taxpayers H and J are married and file a joint return.  H and J have three children: K, age 21, L, age 15, and M, age 10.  No member of the family has minimum essential coverage for any month in 2016.  H and J’s household income is $120,000.  H and J’s applicable filing threshold is $24,000.  The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000. (ii) For each month in 2016, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the applicable dollar amount is $2,780 (($695 x 3 adults) + (($695/2) x 2 children)).  Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,780 and $2,085 ($695 x 3)).  Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess income amount is $2,400 (($120,000 - $24,000) x 0.025).  Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the monthly penalty amount is $200 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $200 ($2,400/12)).   (iii) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $2,400 ($200 x 12).  The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $20,000 ($20,000/12 x 12).  Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on H and J for 2016 is $2,400 (the lesser of $2,400 or $20,000).  To me this says IF the 2 parents do not have health insurance for their 3 kids they will pay a penalty of $2400 each ($4800 total). Am I reading this correctly?What the hell is CNS News?For comparison the UK spends ~$3,000 per capita per year on the NHS. That's $12,000 for 4. It's usually said that the USA spends something like twice per capita what we do, so this sounds vaguely realistic.What is a ""bronze plan""? Isn't this just an automated averaging of national insurance prices, and therefore totally the insurer's fault?Honestly Obamacare is one of the dumbest pieces of legislation ever conceived. We need a better way to do health care (universal/public) not just paying for everyones, which doesn't solve anything."
255,"This is a matter of debate, not fact-checking. Constitutional questions are never cut-and-dry unless there's a Supreme Court decision that directly overrules or upholds a law or, in this case, an executive action.Additionally, the question of what the president is personally responsible for is subjective. After all, Obama may have proposed and later signed the Affordable Care Act, but it was drafted, revised and passed by the legislative branch.The one that I would deem unconstitutional is the Obama administration's killing of Awlaki.  US citizens are entitled to due process.  Reddit was filled with stories of the Bush administration unconstitutional actions in regards to revoking Padilla's *habeas corpus* rights.  The Obama administration took it a step further and those who were critical of Bush have been largely silent in regards to Obama.I can tell you Obamacare is constitutional. The Supreme Court already ruled on it and ruled it constitutional. To debate against that any more is pretty moot.There are some very very legitimate arguments as to why Obamacare is not constitutional.  In the course of oral arguments in favor of Obamacare the supreme court case Wickard v. Filburn (1942) was referenced I believe 14 times.  Filburn was a farmer who was growing wheat, at the time (I don't know about the current situation) there was a law limiting the amount of wheat farmers could produce and sell.  Filburn was growing wheat to sell, but he also had a personal plot of wheat which he was growing for personal use.  The court ruled that Filburn had to burn his excess crop because by not buying wheat he was affecting the supply and demand of the wheat market and because the wheat market crosses state borders, the government gave itself the power to regulate how much wheat you can grow for personal use, by virtue of the interstate commerce clause.  I think this was a terrible decision and I think it was a terrible idea on the part of the proponents of Obamacare to reference this case as a justification for why the federal government can impose fines on us for not purchasing a product (health insurance).  During the arguments they tried to paint the mandate as a fine rather than a tax, but Chief Justice John Roberts actually ruled in favor of the mandate only because he considered it to be a tax and therefore a power of the federal government.  So for the first time in our history, Americans will be taxed for products they didn't actually purchase.  >To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;This is from Article 1, section 8 of the constitution, as you have surely noticed, nothing in that sentence grants Congress the power to force citizens to purchase products or companies to provide health insurance.  Furthermore, the original usage of the word regulate does not mean what it does today, the original meaning of regulate is ""to make regular"".  Implying that Congress was never supposed to generate commerce but really to act as a mediator between trading states.  It takes a lengthy extrapolation (in my opinion) for the court to rule that Congress' power to make trade between the states regular is actually the power to determine how much wheat an individual can produce for personal consumption, whether a business provides health benefits or whether an individual buys health care.I can verify the first one.  Part of ObamaCare was ruled unconstitutional (Medicare funds can be cut from states that refuse to comply with the expansion.)  The rest of the law stands and was brought before the supreme court for a review.As for the second one all I can say is that if it was unconstitutional the republicans would be putting him through impeachment as we speak.No, he has not done anything unconstitutional. Obamacare as upheld in the Supreme Court, and he is the Commander-in-Chief  of the armed forces. I don't know the law, but I imagine he has a fair amount of leeway to take out baddies under the ""war on terror"" heading.When people don't like what Obama (or Bush, or whoever) is doing, they like to call it unconstitutional. That way it becomes a fundamental violation of rights, rather than a disagreement on policy.The problem is that most people (i.e. anyone who's not intimately familiar with constitutional law) don't know what is and is not constitutional.There's a lot of stuff where you *can make the argument* that Obama acted outside the constitution, but that doesn't mean he actually has.He made recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board despite the Senate conducting pro forma sessions each day...just like Stalin.[Wall St Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324039504578263772492524536.html)We can start with those 23 executive orders trying to curtail the 2nd amendment. How about the killing of a 16 year old american citizen in yemen with a drone. How about those kill lists? What about the NDAA? RFID chips? Obama renewing the patriot act too. Those are just a few examples.For Obamacare, no. Obamacare was ruled Constitutional by the US Supreme Court. There are multiple arguments to be made for unconstitutional actions and actions requiring impeachment, however. While I hate to quote Alex Jones, the articles of impeachment he (almost) filed against the President are worth a read, as they relate to this topic.http://www.infowars.com/citizens-file-article-of-impeachment-against-obama/It should be noted that a lot of this was written before the ""gun-control"" orders were released; however, many of these reasons actually stand up as true. Whether they actually equal up to impeachable crimes is up for debate.The war on drugs is a huge infringement on individual's personal freedoms. I would argue that means it's unconstitutional. But our constitution needs a revamp for the 21st century anyways, it's fucked."

257,"No. The Egyptian government [purchased](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2010/march/LockheedMartinReceives213.html) the F16s through the Foreign Military Sales program. When a deal like this is made, the US government gives a foreign government a loan through the Export-Import Bank which the foreign government uses to make the purchases. The foreign government then pays back the loan over time.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Military_SalesNot only is it not a ""gift"" I don't see how this is bad for the USA. $213 million goes into sustaining american jobs and the government gets paid back. This article is kind of like claiming that Toyota is gifting cars to Americans just because we buy the car from a local privately owned dealership and not directly from Toyota. Yes that is a car analogy which is always a bit of stretch to pull off but considering the obvious bias of the articles wording I wouldn't have considered it true to begin with. It really gets old, with so many legitimate complaints that can be raised against the current president I don't see why people would keep making shit up. Reminds me of the Obama ring saying ""there is no god but allah"" BS.As long as the US is getting paid for the military equipment, then no, they are not ""gifts."" We just have to make sure the equipment is going to the right places and people. We don't want another situation like the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980's where the equipment we gave the Jihad in Afghanistan was eventually used against us in Afghanistan and Iraq after September 11.Yes. If you checked the source in the article, you'd see it was from Fox news. Fox is biased, but it's hard to make up a story about multimillion dollar weapons deals.

According to the story at the time, soldiers were asked to complete a survey which, among other things, asked if they would be willing to fire on US citizens. While I could not find a source from the 1990's, I did find a [forum thread](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1088237/posts)  in which this was discussed in 2004.In the event of a citizen uprising against the installed power base wouldn't the military be used to stop the uprising?  Does it matter if its red or blue?  I think the fact that this could happen and if part of the military you may be called to use such force is a given.I think that will be very hard to 'prove' or not. What you're really dealing with is hearsay. Something that the person doing the original talking really can't back up with hard 'facts' other than what they saw. Unless there's something official that's leaked, then no way to prove this. (And I doubt there'd be a memo stating this exactly. The government is good at plausible deniability.)Fairly certain DoD and other federal agencies ask this of employees and have for some time.Like most of the paranoid delusions that the extremist right-wing ""examiner.com"" publishes, this is bullshit.However, if they are domestic terrorists such as Timothy McVeigh and his ilk of ""Turner Diaries"" pud-pullers, I really don't see a problem."
260,"First, it's always a bit odd to make claims about how much money we'd get from massive tax changes. There are *so* many secondary effects from changing tax rates that unless someone has seriously studied the situation - which they almost never have - chances are that their guesses, if right, are right only coincidentally.That said, *assuming all else stays the same*, which it won't:A while back I did an [income breakdown](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/klzqq/70_of_all_income_tax_comes_from_the_top_10_of/c2lh23z) aimed at figuring out the taxes required for a basic income. The details aren't really relevant - the important part is that I have some useful numbers on exactly how much income the top 1.5% have. (Not the top 1%, sadly, but we work with what we have.)The numbers I came up with: the top 1.5% consists of roughly 2,240,000 families, making an average of $448,687 yearly. Total, that's $1,005,058,880,000 dollars, or a little over one trillion. Total US federal spending is, as of 2011, a bit over [3.5 trillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png), so a 100% tax on the top 1.5% would give the government enough money to function for around 100 days. Presumably restricting that to the top 1% would end up with more than 66 days, since we're keeping the most valuable people.There's the best numbers I can manage right now. If you can find average-income and counts of other groups, like ""top 1%"" or ""billionaires"", then I'm sure there are other interesting stats that can be derived, some of which may end up with that 10% number.Fox News stated this recently.  But I find little validity to the statement.  First, as the average worker's wages have stagnated, the money going to the richest (the 1% and above) has increased 275% since Reagan's election.What this is disputing is the [No Billionaires tax](http://www.nobillionaires.com/) that is being proposed by Thom Hartmann, a Socialist commentator.  In his words:>This is the point billionaire Nick Hanauer was making in his recent TED talk explaining why rich people aren’t job creators (He also said the same thing on The Big Picture with Thom Hartmann). As he said, “There can never be enough super-rich Americans to power a great economy. The annual earnings of people like me are hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than those of the median American, but we don't buy hundreds or thousands of times more stuff.”>If the 400 richest billionaires in America could generate just as much economy activity alone as the rest of us can, then maybe there'd be an argument for such vast wealth. But they can’t. The typical billionaire doesn’t buy thousands of more pairs of pants, or dine out thousands of more times, or buy thousands of more cars typical working class American.>Hanauer concludes, “I can't buy enough of anything to make up for the fact that millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans can't buy any new clothes or cars or enjoy any meals out. Or to make up for the decreasing consumption of the vast majority of American families that are barely squeaking by, buried by spiraling costs and trapped by stagnant or declining wages.”Well, according to the mods...if you don't offer up a link to the source, they will delete your post.

I'm trying to find the exact quote, but Thomas doesn't have the full transcript from the House floor yesterday.My rush transcript, from about 5:29:00 on Thomas's video of yesterday's House floor: > What we're saying with these programs is you need to be eligible for the actual benefit to receive the benefit. That's not asking too much.

This makes more working-class families eligible, but the standard is still tougher than what’s used in 26 states today — including Texas, which allows households earning up to 165 percent of poverty to qualify for SNAP benefits.So, I'm going false. The implication was that this is cutting wasteful spending and/or fraud, but it's really about raising and standardizing the eligibility threshold.

262,"Nope, it's bullshit.http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/13846/is-todays-unemployment-worse-than-the-great-depression/13849#13849This comes up periodically on some of my partisan political subs, and when people are paying attention it gets smacked down pretty quick.The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment several different ways.This [chart](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) shows the measurement that is reported by the media.  This is called the U-3 measurement.This [page](http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab15.htm) allows you to get unemployment numbers measured 6 different ways.  The BLS calls them U-1 through U-6.Some people (including myself) think that U-6 is a more accurate picture of unemployment.To get the numbers in the picture, you have to include everyone that's dropped out of the labor force since President Obama took office, including those that have retired.Unemployment is high, and for some groups in the labor force (blacks), unemployment is around 25%.  But general unemployment is more like 12 - 15 percent, not 20+ percent.I don't know how unemployment was measured in the 1930's.I'm not sure what is different about how we measure it now versus then, but since there were no child labor laws back then, and many kids were forced to work to help out their families, I think it would be safe to assume that children would be counted as well when talking about how to measure the rates back then. Adding them all into the mix would drop the unemployment rates. I'm not sure this dictates this as ""true"" but I believe this theory would make the Great Depression numbers lower. Or I could be completely off.I think they measure it by how many people collect unemployment. So once their two years of unemployment is up they aren't considered unemployed. Not 100% but that's what I've heard"

Every drone strike though, makes a whole village join my cause.'.   And I believe he's right. The US military looks at some short term success, but completely ignore the long term effects. They will be deviating.You could just as easily say that Al Qaida killed over 173 children in Pakistan by using them as human shields.So, why are you so quick to blame the American government?[deleted]Just curious... was this inspired by reading the ""joke that killed a career"" thread that spiraled off into a entirely unproductive 9/11 conversation after someone brought up Bill Maher?"

Shale natural gas is mined by fracking, namely injections of powerful cocktails of chemicals into the bedrock to fracture the rock and let the gas seep out. If any of the injection chemicals, or any of the released gas misses the capture pipe and leaks out into the atmosphere, you could possibly end of with disastrous level of emissions. [It is not clear whether it is possible to frack natural gas without leaking gas or methane.](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/0213/Fracking-study-sends-alert-about-leakage-of-potent-greenhouse-gas) The industry is saying it is all perfectly safe, but there have been enough accident already that their credibility is strained.This is under pretty serious academic discussion at the moment due to the potential for greater methane leaks during production. I'm on my phone right now, but I believe this is the paper that sparked this debate http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0061-5?LI=trueEssentially, they are proposing that unconventional shale gas has higher ghg equivalent emissions than even coal when the entire production cycle is taken into account. There have been numerous critiques and rebuttals on both sides since then. Personally, I do not think this will ever be resolved satisfactorily for everyone, the accounting methods are simply too different from one study to the next.This only covers the actual burning. You also need to consider methane leaks from production and ground/water pollution.gmarceau has the facts. The key point here is that there's less carbon per unit of energy in methane than in coal - coal contains lots of carbon molecules that release various amounts of energy; natural gas is much simpler, it contains mostly one type of carbon molecule that releases a good amount of energy as it burns and burns very cleanly, so there's no soot.isn't America also supposed to have massive shale oil reserves more than all of the middle east combined? also i think kilowatt for kilowatt nuke energy emits a lot less carbon, and i think coal plants release more radioactivity than a nuke plant.... right?"
266,"According to the [Belfast Telegraph](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/university-flag-fine-claim-lunacy-16021165.html), the university received funding from the EU, and failed to acknowledge that fact.

Usually a the sign that identifies the place will have a little EU flag in the corner and say ""Part funded by the European Union"". There is no requirement to actually fly a flag though.The Express (and the Daily Mail) are extremely Euro-sceptic and will take any opportunity to depict the EU as anti-democratic beurocrats for the sake of beurocracy."
267,"It does seem to be that the rate of growth of health care cost is significant, and given that it's now about $10,000 for family coverage, it would seem logical that this is a factor.On the other hand, this is a more recent trend than the stagnation of wage growth, and many middle class jobs don't have coverage. A study would need to look at that factor a bit more robustly than anything I found with my cursory search.Ok according to Kaiser Family Foundation, the average cost of covering a single person is $468 a month, $1,312 a month for a family. [Link](http://ehbs.kff.org/?page=charts&id=1&sn=6&p=1). The question then becomes how much has wages stagnated? Well right now the median income in the US is at $44,389. Add in the fact that only 1.9% of the population sits above the $250,000 threshold, and around 13% below poverty (meaning making less than $23,050), we can see that most incomes sit between those two factors. Obviously with more data you will see that a majority will sit actually at the medium income to up to $75,000. So how does that stack up? Well the median income in 1999 was $42,000, or in today's money, about $56,000. So let's break that difference down by month. The difference in median household income is around $13,000 a year or $1,083 a month. Now that's less than the current health care cost for a family, but much greater than than the cost for someone single. But that doesn't take into effect the previous cost of insuring someone. In 1999 the cost of insuring your workers was $1.03 an hour, or around $164.80 a person. Then you factor in the $67.57 the average worker paid, you get a total of $232.57 a month, on average. [Link](http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2010/mobile/ted_20101101.htm). But this isn't the final story either, because the average spending by an employer has increased from $1.03 an hour (or $164.80 a month) to $2.00 an hour (or $320 a month), the cost to the employee has increased from $67.57 a month to $92.43 a month (for single coverage, family follows the same path). So if you just factor in what the employer's pay, and not what the employees pay, you find that, no, health insurance cost are not the main reason for stagnant wages. It does play a rather large factor, and if health insurance cost were down to 1999 levels (adjusted for inflation, which in this last paragraph I did not do, because the factor of growth in health insurance costs exceeds inflation, so knowing that wouldn't help much) then income could be at that level, but with that being said, we are still off the median income of 1999, compared to today, at a greater rate than what insurance costs.http://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compensation/This publication makes the distinction between median compensation and median wage.Compared to:http://www.epi.org/blog/real-hourly-wage-growth-last-generation/I'd consider a 11% growth over nearly 40 years to be stagnant, given that the GDP/capita has nearly tripled.false at least in my case."
268,"sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2012G.htmlTotal number of eligible voters: 219,296,589Total number of votes Obama: 64,385,262Total number of votes Romney: 60,209,277Total number of votes (Excluding third party): 124,594,539Delta between the two: 94,702,050By these numbers It would appear that 94 million people who COULD HAVE voted DID NOT vote regardless of if they were registered. I did exclude non-Obama/Romney votes, but I don't believe 'Other' got 30 million votes. Does this matter? Not really. If you are from a state that is 'a sure thing' then a lot of people don't bother. I'm a Republican from Maryland. my vote for president has 0 impact on the outcome (it does effect other things) so I know a lot of people that don't bother.It would be better stated that the majority didn't vote.I'm going to mark this as **False**Firstly, as ilwolf points out, turnout for elections is universally poor in America, so the poor voter turnout is nothing unusual for this election. Additionally, while [this year's turnout was lower than the last two presidential elections, it's still higher than in 2000](http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/national/election-results-2012-voter-turnout-lower-than-2008-and-2004-report-says).Secondly, as Tsos1312 points out, not every American is actually registered to vote. In fact, it bears mention that many (those under the voting age, those banned from voting due to felony disenfranchisement, those serving time in prison, etc.) couldn't vote even if they wanted to. The number of people under the age of 18, in and of itself, accounts for 23.7% of the population of the United States ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_us#Age_structure)). Another 5.3 Million (roughly 1.6% by my calculations) are restricted from voting due to felony disenfranchisement ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement)), and yet another 0.7% are currently in prison right now ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States)). Kinda' hard to say they ""voted for nobody"" when they're not allowed to vote at all.Thirdly, as aransyn points out, the claim itself is a misstatement to begin with - it's not that they voted for nobody, it's that they didn't vote. Big difference.Fourthly, as TopRamen points out, even if we said that the people not voting counted as ""a vote for nobody"", they still wouldn't have a majority, but a *plurality*. And they wouldn't even have *that* unless you count all of those people I mentioned earlier who are not allowed to vote - Turnout is estimated to be 57.5 ([Source](http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/national/election-results-2012-voter-turnout-lower-than-2008-and-2004-report-says)), with Obama currently getting an estimated 50.9% of the vote ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_us_presidential_election)), making the percentage of the population who voted for him roughly 29.3%, while the population that didn't vote (42.5%) minus those who *couldn't* vote (over 26%) is only 16.5%. Hell, even Mitt Romney beat those numbers.Since the implication of the claim seems to be that most people preferred no candidate, as opposed to Obama, Romney, or one of the other third-party candidates, the general implication of this claim is false. And while you could simply say that this is a misstatement of the claim ""The number of people who didn't vote outnumbers the number of people who voted for Obama"", but that claim is *also* wrong (again, assuming we're talking about people who are actually *allowed* to vote), and it is not the claim being made here anyway.So this claim is both technically wrong, wrong for what it implies, *and* is taken way out of context, which is quite a feat for a claim consisting of less than a dozen words.Note: My numbers and slapnuttz's numbers seem to be at odds, but while I could research this further, it doesn't really affect that this is a bunk claim all-around.Not every American is a registered voterI was aware of that (hence my parenthesis statement) but I do  agree that it is about sending a message for third party. I need to see what Maryland third party numbers were and see if I should feel bad.[Here are voting turnout rates through 2008.](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php) It doesn't list 2012, but I think the turnout, overall, was similar to 2008.If you break those numbers down into essentially three sections (Candidate A, Candidate B, and No One) you can see that for most elections in this country that statement would be true, as turnout as high as 80 percent is rare.In other words, even if that meme is factually true, it's not limited to this election or Pres. Obama; it's true of most elections in our history.We have terrible voter turnout overall.In any democratic election the relevant majority referred to is the majority of people who cared enough to cast a ballot and VOTE. As long as you are able to write-in or indicate on the ballot that you are not voting for any of the candidates on the ballot, you do not get to claim that those that apathetically or just pathetically failed to even do that actually posed any meaningful political action or statement.I think what it means is that the majority didn't favor any one candidateIt's true. Most American's don't vote. That's why fascists like Bush and Obama keep getting elected."

Sometimes, some idiot will throw shit at them. Westboro Baptists are within their rights, and they shouldn't be physically attacked, but in a way you must sympathize with the people throwing stuff even as you disagree with them.The biggest difference, for your father, is that here it's muslim children throwing trash, with the Westboro Baptist Church it's ""patriotic"" people defending the US or the military."

272,"People are always surprised by this, but this is accurate (assuming you are referring to federal taxes).If you look [here](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456) (data taken from CBO) you'll find that for **all** federal taxes in 2009 (not just income taxes), the effective tax rate for all income quintiles (from bottom to top) are 1.0, 6.8, 11.1, 15.1 and 23.2. The 11.1% corresponds to the middle quintile of income earners (whether that's the ""middle class"" or not is tougher to answer). There's more fine-grained data on the rich as well, for example, the ""1%"" pay an average 28.9% effective tax rate.Your own effective tax rate is probably lower than you think it is. I suggest you look up your past tax return and compare your total tax liability to your AGI. You might be pleasantly surprised!You might also be surprised because you've been hearing that the rich pay less than the poor. This is true for a very small subset of rich people like Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney who make absurd amounts of money on some extremely good investments which is taxed at Capital Gains rates. However, most rich people don't make all their money this way and in fact do pay higher effective tax rates (as the data shows).I believe this is the CBO Report referenced in the article.http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373Since it was published in July 2012, and shows data from 2009.Check the supplemental data spreadsheet for moreFederal, yes.But of all tax revenue collected....http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2012/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america.phpThe top 1% pay 29% of their income in taxes, whereas the middle quintile pays 25.2%.Thanks guys for the really good sources. I always knew higher quintiles payed a much heavier share of the tax revenue as they should, considering they have the largest shares of wealth and income.You are making the mistake of only looking at federal income taxes.

You could also do a chart of who pays the most in payroll taxes and the wealthy would pay by far the least.The only correct method is looking at all tax levels.Something that is similar and may interest youhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/other-countries-dont-have-a-47/"
273,"Assuming that you meant ACA not AHA? Assuming since you've referenced Medicare, you're in the United States.Like anyone else, doctors are free to leave any job that they feel pays them inadequately. They can seek employment at other hospitals, other practices, or even start their own practice. There is no single organization - with Obamacare or without - that sets physician salaries, and if anyone has had their salary ""capped"" it has more to do with a lousy employer. Nothing to do with ACA. In short, doctors are subject to the freemarketplace like anyone else. Simple supply and demand economics would suggest that the aging of the baby boomers is likely to create a [shortage](https://www.aamc.org/download/100598/data/recentworkforcestudies.pdf) of [doctors](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-1453827.html).I can address the Independent Medicare Advisory Board (or Independed Payment Advisory Board); you can [read the ACA yourself](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/authorities/patient-protection.pdf) (relevant section starts on page 982, section 3403 onwards).Here are the highlights:* The IPAB is supposed to track projected Medicare spending and make recommendations to Congress if Medicare starts getting too expensive. * If Congress doesn't control the spending, the IPAB steps in and implements the recommendations. * The IIAB cannot ""include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria""* It also cannot, prior to 2019, ""include any recommendation that would reduce payment rates for items and services furnished"" before 2020.* It can only garner a certain percentage of savings (ramping up to a maximum of 1.5% by 2018)* Congress can pass a joint resolution to remove the IPAB in 2017, before major changes can happenI guess what *could* happen is, after 2019, it starts reducing reimbursement rates for Medicare, it would potentially decrease a doctor's income. From what I see on the [AMA website](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/current-topics-advocacy/independent-payment-advisory-board.page), this is probably what they mean. I don't know of a specific cap on a doctor's salary, but they might get reimbursed less if they treat Medicare patients.I have no idea about the $50k thing, though. IIRC, I think there was some discussion about that while the ACA was being drafted, but I can't find it.

274,"I'm going to go ahead and say that your submission (itself) is False.  The article does not make it sound like Obama's going to kill people through the internet.  If you think it does, please quote the part that gives you that impression.  You may have read ""President Obama Unilaterally Gives Cybersecurity Powers to the Military"" as ""President Obama Gives Unilateral Cybersecurity Powers to the Military,"" but that's an inaccurate reading.In any case, the article has very little content, as it is an editorial commentary on a separate piece of journalism, [taken from the Washington Post and linked](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-signs-secret-cybersecurity-directive-allowing-more-aggressive-military-role/2012/11/14/7bf51512-2cde-11e2-9ac2-1c61452669c3_story.html).  And if you want to know the sort of powers being (conjecturally) granted to the military:> An example of a defensive cyber-operation that once would have been considered an offensive act, for instance, might include stopping a computer attack by severing the link between an overseas server and a targeted domestic computer.So we're not talking about killing people over the internet; we're just talking about the reclassification of actions which would previously have been considered ""offensive"" as ""defensive,"" thereby making the military's stance on cybersecurity more aggressive.  Reason's objection, which they make quite clearly, is that Obama made this change unilaterally, in a presidential directive, despite the fact that Congress had recently rejected legislation which would have achieved a similar reclassification.  But Reason is effectively accusing the President of bad faith here, not any illegal abuse of power: he can sign any executive order he wants, and since the directive is classified any claim at this point that it oversteps Presidential authority is necessarily unverifiable.How exactly would you kill someone ""through the internet""? Sending someone hundreds of links to Goatse.cx?Since we cant read Presidential Policy Directive 20, all anyone can do is speculate.Comments about the bias of news sources don't belong on this sub reddit.How was this stupidity ""partisan bias"" when it is just outright crazy?

275,"For some background, [I looked at what they said about it in about.com's business law/tax area:](http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/healthcarebusinesstax/f/How-Does-Health-Care-Law-Affect-Business.htm)> The health care law doesn't ""require"" larger employers to provide health care to employees, but beginning in 2014 the law imposes penalties on businesses with over 50 employees that don't provide ""affordable"" health care to employees. Here are the details of this portion of the law:>* Starting in 2014, large businesses (those with 50 or more full-time workers) that do not provide adequate health insurance will be required to pay an assessment if their employees receive premium tax credits to buy their own insurance. These assessments will offset part of the cost of these tax credits. The assessment for a large employer that does not offer coverage will be $2,000 per full-time employee beyond the company's first 30 workers.> * To be deemed ""affordable,"" the health care insurance provided by the employer must pay for at least 60 percent of covered health care expenses, and employees may not be forced to pay more than 9.5 percent of their family income (before deductions and adjustments) for coverage offered by employers. The question of how an employer is supposed to know the amount of ""family income"" is not yet addressed.> * If a business fails to provide any coverage or the coverage is deemed not to be affordable, the amount of the penalty is $2,000 per worker, but the first 30 workers are excluded from the calculation.So, it would appear that Obamacare doesn't *require* it, but it will  make things awfully uncomfortable for those employers that choose not to provide coverage for their employees.  I say **Mostly True** for this one.As someone who has spent a [lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) of time reading through and talking about the bill. (a **[lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/)** of time), I can confirm that this is pretty much true, although there's a lot of partisan bias in the tone.If you're curious about the rules for when this employer mandate kicks in, Kaiser has a flowchart [here](http://healthreform.kff.org/the-basics/employer-penalty-flowchart.aspx) that does a pretty good job of explaining the requirements.However, it bears mention that businesses with 25 employees or fewer, while not required to buy insurance for their employees, will actually get tax credits to help pay for insurance if they choose to buy insurance. This means that small businesses will be *much* more competitive in the job market when it comes to attracting good employees.However, the brunt of what this claim is saying is true - businesses with 50+ employees must provide health insurance to all employees working over 30 hours a week or pay a penalty.**True** or **Mostly True** - It doesn't paint the entire picture, but it catches the major points and is fairly accurate, if a tiny bit biased in tone.Just to be clear, you're asking for a factcheck about an economic downturn that someone says is ""about to occur?""I say let them cut hours and watch them lose employees in droves. Or lay their employees off, unable to keep up with customer demand, they lose business. The fact is employers need employees to make money. Its just that simple.Lord forbid you did the moral and christian thing and gave back something to the people who help you succeedThe facts of this are **True**. Obamacare does require that employers with 50+ employees provide healthcare to workers, or face up to $2000 in fines per employee (past 30 employees):[healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/using-insurance/employers/large-business/index.html)Some people (like the author of this) think this is a bad thing, so they are extrapolating from those facts their prediction of the effects. They are also basing their conclusions on a pretty small subset of data, 2 very large businesses that for some reason they characterize as ""growth oriented"".Not much wrong with this though.They are not required to pay the full premium, though this seems to be what everyone thinks. The businesses will have to offer insurance that covers 60% of typical healthcare costs *and* costs the employee no more than 10% of their family income. Otherwise they can be subject to a fine based on the number of employee's whose plans don't meet those criteria if those employees receive government credit to buy their own insurance. Also, I'm pretty sure they don't count the first 20 or 30 employees.So, yes, they will be reuired to offer insurance and it has to be ""affordable"" according to the government's standars. They are not simply required to pay full premiums of all fulltime employees once they hit 50 fulltime workers."
276,"It depends on the company in question as to specific prices, but the Dow Jones and S&P500 have risen substantially from the troughs they were in after the housing crash when Obama took over, and are up substantially over the course of the Obama admin. As to it being relevant to Obama's policies, the relationship is nebulous at best.  Obama's statements and policies can of course affect the economy indirectly, but to say that anything he says or does has a direct impact on stock prices would be farfetched in a majority of cases.  Stock prices are driven generally by investors' confidence in the future of the company.  They might take a dip if Obama said he wanted to criminalize pizza, for example, or a military contractor might increase if he announced he was expanding military budgets and therefore defense contracts.  But there are tons of other factors, such as its financial liabilities, the climate of the company's respective sector, and any other number of things that are nothing to do with the president.  But overall, most market indicators have gone up substantially during his first term.  [Dow Jones](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/historical/djia1900.html) - rose roughly 5,000 points and is near historic highs[S&P 500](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5Egspc+interactive#symbol=^gspc;range=20090120,20121114;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) - Up by about 500 points which is about an increase of 50% from the start dateThe S&P 500 is generally the best broad indicator of market conditions, although the DJIA is what most people generally cite.  I had a lengthy convo about this the day after the election when everyone on facebooking was boo-hooing a sudden drop as though it meant Obama was economic antichrist.  Will post specifics shortly.

EDIT - It seems the only one I can see in the slideshow on HuffPo is Papa Johns, none of the others will load.  If you want to post a list of the companies in question, I can work with that or you can plug them into Yahoo finance.  Long story short, at least in the case of PJ, I would rate the HuffPo claim that it went up under Obama as true, but mostly meaningless, because it has much more to do with how the company is run, its position in the restaurant market, future prospects, cash flow and liabilities, etc, than it has to do with Obama.  Schnatter is blowing hot air and FUD, and seeking to blame others for any potential woes he foresees in his future, though I don't even see why he has any fear of the future because all companies of his size will be facing the same legal challenges with Obamacare.[deleted]For papa johns a quick google search will show that their stock has gone up steadily since late 2008Most of the costs of the PPACA haven't hit yet, and won't until 2014.Heres [another](http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/06/opinion/otis-regulations-job-creation/index.html) CEO that dislikes regulation."

Why didn't they do something then, considering W was worried about Fannie and Freddie ""since 2001""? And how was Obama fighting against them way back then?Consecutive months of job growth: sounds high. I grabbed the [BLS data](http://www.bls.gov/bdm/) for private sector gained and lost and created a quickie array of ""margin"". From Q3 2003 to Q3 2007, the numbers are all positive. I'm on my lunch break, so I don't have time to find month-by-month, but some (Q3 2006, especially) created very few jobs in the quarter, so I'd be surprised if every month was slightly positive. Then again, the gov't sector increased during the Bush administration, so those may be the jobs I'm missing. ""If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 one which was tiny"" (paraphrased) That's quite misleading. The major Bush policies that ran up the deficit were kind of entrenched at the time (tax cuts, wars, etc.) and it would have been somewhere between difficult and reckless to have tried to extricate ourselves from them immediately. Combine that with the impending financial disaster (decreasing revenues will inherently increase deficits), it's hard to lay everything at the Dems feet. Not that this post is trying to do that, of course. It's blaming everything on the Dems, but it closes with ""If you can't admit at least part of the mess is the result of Democrat and Obama's policies... (middle finger)"". Classic strawman. ""Even though I just said everything's Obama's fault, I'm not saying everything's Obama's fault. Just that he has to take a percentage of the responsibility. Somewhere in the vicinity of 100%.""P.S.

278,"This is the report from the Tax Foundation http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/sr139.pdfThis is the Census 2005 Flow of Federal Funds Report that the Tax Foundation study is referencinghttp://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/cffr-05.pdfNow by looking at these reports we immediately learn two things. 1: Per capita tax burden primarily relies on income tax revenue and is calculated as total taxes divided by population. 2: Per capita federal expenditures includes all federal spending with the largest share being retirement and disability spending. Immediately looking at the first point we see a problem. Due to the progressiveness of income taxes, states with higher populations of wealthy individuals will skew per capita income data upwards. It also ignores income and tax inequality in that the per capita tax burden assigns a state's total tax burden equally across all of it's residents. This is noted in the report:>The results of the study have been controversial for years because they show that the nation is not only redistributing income from the prosperous to the poor, but from the middle-income residents of high-cost states to the middle-income residents of low-cost states.>>Thanks to a steeply progressive federal income tax, states with higher incomes pay vastly higher federal taxes, payments that are unlikely ever to be matched by federal spending directed to those states. Ironically, most of these high-paying states are the so-called blue states that have generally elected politicians who support a more steeply progressive tax system even though their own constituents bear a greater share of the burden as the code gets more progressive.>><snip>>>This state-by-state variation in federal tax burdens per capita is primarily due to the difference in per capita income among the states. Since both of the federal government’s largest revenue raisers, the individual income tax and the payroll tax, are levied as a percentage of income, states with high income per capita will also have high federal tax collections per capita. This effect is intensified by the progressivity of the income tax system which causes tax burdens to rise more rapidly than income as the economy grows.The second point comes down to a matter of definition. What federal spending is considered welfare? Is social security, and disability insurance considered welfare? If we assume this than there will be a clear skew in the data towards states with a higher elderly population like Florida. For argument's sake I'll define welfare as direct payments to individuals, other than for retirement and disability. If anyone has an issue with this classification feel free to provide your analysis of the data. The CFFR report classifies this spending under ""Other Direct Payments"" (page x). As listed in the excerpt below it is combined with direct payments, other than for individuals. However for convenience sake we will ignore that due to it being such a small portion of that number. >Programs classified as other direct payments in Table 3 include two CFFR object categories. The first object category (code ‘‘DO’’) is direct payments for individuals, other than for retirement and disability. The second object category (code ‘‘DX’’) is direct payments, other than for individuals. The first object category contains far more expenditure than the second object category. For convenience of presentation, these two object categories are combined in the CFFR publication, but are available separately in the CFFR databasI chose this item because from the report we learn this category includes the following, among other things (page x):* Excess Earned Income Tax Credits* Agricultural Subsidies* Food Stamps* Unemployment Compensation* MedicareNow we can turn back to the Tax Foundation report in order to see how Other Direct Payments per capita breaks down by state noted in Table 5. It seems this portion of federal expenditures is pretty evenly distributed among the states. The Tax Foundation comes to the same conclusion:>Some federal spending patterns are easily discernible. The large number of retirees collecting Social Security in Florida increases the flow of federal “retirement and disability” funds somewhat. An even bigger difference is created by the is proportionately large federal grants funneled to Alaska and the District of Columbia. On the other hand, direct payments to individuals tend to be more evenly distributed across the country.[Here](http://democraticactionteam.org/redstatesocialism/) is a chart that went around a few years ago.And [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/) is PolitiFact fact checking. PolitiFact downgraded this to *Mostly True* solely due to the data being a few years old and a couple states changed colors.So the answer to your question is yes, red states take the lions share of federal money. Seems like blue states are the makers and red states the takers.http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/fedspend_per_taxesbystate-20071009.pdfThere you go, above a buck is bad, below a buck is good.  Got one in front of me w/ how people voted in the election... looks like if we make the cutoff 1.10 (a state could shift around it's finances to become solvent?), we get to split the states down the middle between being in the red and in the black (oops, more color metaphors...), so in the top 25:18/25 = red, 4/25 = blue (New Mexico is 1st though, bummer...), and 2/25 were undecided at the time I marked this thing up... and I'm too lazy to go check.I would say that ""tend to rely"" is a correct assessment based on these numbers.  Umm I'm more of a laymen when it comes to these matters, so I'd rather have a conversation in simple terms than vouch for the accuracy of this interpretation.Question is, how did they calculate that list?  What goes into federal aid in/out calcs?  Also 2005 is pretty old...Also not sure if I did it right, is this how you check things?[This article](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union) may be helpful.Here's a short [2011 article from the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union), which estimates federal taxes minus federal spending per state from 1990-2009 as a percentage of 2009 GDP.  I hope it helps answer your question.There was a group of maps posted here on Reddit a week or two ago, which I can no longer find, that compared the *counties*that received the most federal aid with political affiliation.  They matched up, and were almost entirely blue."

Most, if not all, are due to years long trends or international factors. I'd also like to point out that companies could have planned these announcements to occur in the wake of the election to minimize negative coverage (since the news media's distracted), much like [Zynga did when they announced layoffs during the iPad mini event](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/10/24/pr-trick-announce-bad-news-during-apple-launch-event/).Leaving politics aside for a moment...It doesn't really make sense for a whole bunch of companies to announce layoffs just because of the election. Even if you're reasonably sure another term for Mr. Obama is going to be disastrous for the economy, you don't just make a ton of layoffs right now. You don't know exactly what's going to get passed in the next four years or what it's going to look like. Without that information you can't do that good of a job anticipating exactly where you'll need to save, what jobs you can most easily cut, etc.It's like being the captain of a ship approaching a storm and sending a quarter of your crew off into lifeboats on principle. It's a weird decision to make even if your belief that Mr. Obama's term is going to be disastrous for business is well-founded. You should still wait until you have a better idea of the particulars of the storm so you know how many crew members and which crew members to send away.The mandate isn't in effect until 2014 and the collectives haven't been formed. Therefore, business owners don't know what the financial impacts on their business will be. So no one was able to sit down yet and figure out what the cost impact per employee will be. I conclude that these layoffs were for other reasons than an unknown cost to be imposed over a year from now because of Obamacare.Most businesses will not be able to avoid Obamacare's mandate that employers provide health care for employees by cutting jobs or reducing employee hours.Firstly, this requirement doesn't kick in until 2014 ( [Citation: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Page 174, sec. 4980H](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174) ). If these employers were dropping people specifically for that reason, it would seem sensible to wait until late 2013 to do so.Starting in 2014, large businesses (businesses with 50 or more employees, 100 or more in some states) will be required to either provide health insurance or pay a fee. Switching to part-time only won't help, as the Affordable Care Act counts the hours worked, not just the number of full-time employees you have. So if your employees worked an equivalent of 50 full-time employees' hours, the requirement kicks in. Also, this includes businesses with multiple locations (chain stores, etc.), but *not* independently-owned franchises, as franchises have a separate owner (however, if an individual franchise employs over 50 employees, they *do* fall within the requirement) ( [Citation: Baker Law, a legal website discussing the implications of the bill](http://www.bakerlaw.com/alerts/special-health-care-reform-series-special-focus-on-the-employer-employee-relationship-part-i-8-15-2012/) ).If an employee has 120 hours in a month, that counts as one full-time employee. If two employees each have 60 hours in a month, that counts as one employee. The number of full-time employees doesn't matter. Only the number of hours worked.So yes, they will either still be required to provide coverage or hit with the penalty, unless reducing employees' hours gets them under the *equivalent* of 50 full-time workers' work hours.So really, the only businesses for which this would be a viable strategy are those who have slightly over 50 employees (or the equivalent thereof), can still operate at under 50, have no desire to expand, and are not a part of a large chain. The vast majority of businesses are not likely to fall under this description. According to [entrepeneur.com](http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/220616), businesses making between $10,000 and $10 million of revenue account for just 17 percent of business income, and of those, only 23 percent actually *have* employees.If Obamacare were *really* the cause of layoffs in a business, that business wouldn't be dropping 1500 employees, it'd be dropping 5-10, or reducing the hours of a staff of 60... and they wouldn't be doing so for another year.Those making layoffs now are almost certainly doing so:1. For reasons unrelated to the election and Obamacare2. For reasons unrelated to the election and Obamacare, but using the election and Obamacare as an excuse to save face.3. Because they personally oppose Barack Obama and Obamacare, and are looking to make a political statement.4. Because they do not understand Obamacare, and are making a decision based purely on their emotional reaction to the election and not based on any real analysis of additional costs they'll be facing.I would rate any claim that Obamacare is causing *current* layoffs as **Mostly False** or **False**. Yes, some employers are citing Obamacare as the reason why they're firing people, but since Obamacare can't logically be the cause of any added costs for these employers for over another year, these employers are clearly doing so either due to a lack of understanding of the bill, as a political statement, or to save face regarding layoffs they were going to make *anyway*.Cherry-picking with a bit of false premise.  Of course some wing-nuts will fire their employees to get back at Obama, but to say that it is the largest reason companies are laying off employees is just ridiculous!Look at all the companies hiring because Obama was re-elected! /sarcasm""Safeway committed to hiring 1000 veterans in 2013...""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/09/4973666/safeway-commits-to-hiring-1000.html""Companies supporting shale industry forecast hiring in 2013""http://www.wfmj.com/story/20047377/companies-supporting-shale-industry-forecast-hiring-in-2013""Empire purchases land in Mason for plant; expected to create 200 jobs""http://masonbuzz.com/2012/11/09/empire-purchases-land-in-mason-for-plant-expected-to-create-200-jobs/""Turning Stone Casino expansion “Exit 33” to create 100 permanent jobs""www.i4u.com/2012/11/expansion-exit-jobs-turning-permanent-stone-33-create-casino-100""Five Below Signs Lease for New Distribution Center in Southern US""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/11/09/five-below-signs-lease-for-new-distribution-center/""Ford Hires 5,200 in Plants, Pushes Utilitization to 114%""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-08/ford-hires-5-200-in-plants-pushes-utilitization-to-114-.html""Convergys to hire 200 at 'contact center'""http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/blog/2012/11/convergys-to-hire-200.html""FreightCenter Ramps Up Hiring Efforts, Announces Expansion and Office Relocation""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/09/4973286/freightcenter-ramps-up-hiring.html""Whirlpool hiring 150; new line in November""http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/article/20121109/NEWS01/311090013/Whirlpool-hiring-150-new-line-November""Red Ventures is ready to hire 400 workers in Indian Land""http://www.heraldonline.com/2012/11/08/4400899/red-ventures-is-ready-to-hire.htmlAmazon Hiring At Least 1,200 Veterans In Coming Yearhttp://news.investors.com/technology/110812-632692-amzn-named-top-military-friendly-employer.htm""Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy to hire 100 new employees""http://drugstorenews.com/article/diplomat-specialty-pharmacy-hire-100-new-employeesAmbassador Hotel hiring near 100 workers, job fair todayhttp://articles.kwch.com/2012-11-07/job-fair-today_34978305http://www.salon.com/2012/11/09/stupid_obama_stock_market_stories/and stop reading, listening to and watching fringe media![Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12y1w4/in_response_to_the_right_wing_mass_email_in_the/) is a might post with documentation showing this is not just a lie, but is a large collection of lies.someone took care of it in [political Discussion] (http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12y1w4/in_response_to_the_right_wing_mass_email_in_the/)Apart from talking directly with the CEO/CFO of every company that is laying people off, I don't think there is any way to verify the reason for the layoffs.I know we don't do this here, but give it the sniff test.  The NYSE is down about 3.5% in 2 days.  It's mid-week so no jobs reports, it's mid-quarter so no earnings reports, no consumer index or confidence reports.  Why the drop?  Which companies/industries are dropping?One thing that is very difficult to quantify is risk.  Saw an interview with a business owner (550 employees) that I think sums up the thinking of most business owners post election.  He said (paraphrasing) ""I would love to expand my business.  There are a lot of opportunities out there, but its just too risky now.""  I think most business owners feel like they are being negatively targeted by the current administration.  This may not be factual, but you can't divorce human psychology from business decisions.I plan to see the current ""hunker down"" business model continue for the next 4 years.Someone is doing God's work and has a [megathread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12y1w4/in_response_to_the_right_wing_mass_email_in_the/) dedicated to debunking each one of these.  I have not personally verified the verifier here, but this should help.[deleted]I've been in business for myself for a long time. I live in Canada now. If I were to expand and need to hire people, I'd do it here because UHC would cost me less. I would not start a business in the US right now.Given that there hasn't been any real debate on this in over two weeks, and there seems to be a pretty good general consensus, I'm going to label this claim as **False**, as it seems to have been adequately demonstrated that the vast majority of these companies laying off employees are doing so for reasons *other* than the Affordable Care Act, and even the few that are actively citing the Affordable Care Act as their reason for doing so seem as though they are very likely using the ACA as a scapegoat."

However, it's not ""moving forward with a measure"", it's moving forward on *talks* about a measure, and it appears that the reason for the timing of the vote on these talks is not due to the election, but Hurricane Sandy.The article you point to seems to be making mountains out of molehills, implying things that haven't happened yet, making assumptions about motivations, and just all-around trying to make this out to be a much bigger deal than it really is.As such, I would think that this should be labeled **Mostly False** or **Partisan Bias**.If it's referring to the news reported in the Reuters article, it's a strong False as that's a proposed international treaty whose effect on the U.S. would be a reduction in weapons exports out of the country. If your position was that guns in America are good, a limit on gun exports out of America would at a minimum be irrelevant.Obviously, the focus is to try and control where weapons go -- you could argue that a future enemy of the U.S., like the Libyan regime once was, would be harmed by Obama's support for these talks."
284,"Let's add to Vanetia's critical thinking:in the election of just a few days ago, some polling areas ended up with higher than average voting turnout and had fewer people working the polls -- so of course polling places were not as prepared. Some states, like Florida, had long ballots, and some places had new machines. Those two factors would add to long lines. See, for example, [this recent piece] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/long-voting-lines-blamed-on-high-turnout-too-few-poll-workers-and-voting-machines/2012/11/07/c1057972-291d-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html) from the Washington Post.BUT:Decisions about the hours of polling sites -- along with decisions about the age and kind of equipment (including the number of voting machines) assigned to any one polling place -- are made by the person in charge of a state's voting. For the 2004 presidential election, districts in Ohio that were poor and black or near universities -- meaning districts likely to vote in a Democratic sort of way -- were given too few machines to handle the expected number of voters. One district of 1300 voters, for example, was given just 2 voting machines. Here's [a take on voting lines] (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/opinion/26tue4.html) -- across the country, but with a focus on Ohio -- from that year.Or, from South Carolina, in this last presidential election, here's [a report of how the number of working machines in a polling place](http://palmettopublicrecord.org/2012/11/06/voter-suppression-south-carolina-style/) affected how many people could vote at any time and hence wait times. (While the title of the page to which I linked is certainly biased, the pertinent information is about numbers, and so isn't biased -- just as the bipartisan assessment at the end shows how this is a problem no matter your party affiliation.)So it doesn't really matter whether a district is urban or rural; the person deciding what equipment goes to a district can have a much larger effect on how long the lines will be. **tl;dr**: There's a lot more going on than whether you live in a city or the country. Voting arrangements are made by the states, and if a state doesn't have updated equipment, or if you have a secretary of state who doesn't value integrity, you will get long lines.[EDIT for wrong word and some formatting, darn it.]From my anecdotal evidence in Prince William County, Virginia the answer is fuck yes. My mom is one county over in Fairfax County and they had three or four machines PLUS five paper ballot lines people could use. It took her about 30 minutes to vote early in the morning (6:15ish). It took my boss in another affluent area of Fairfax County about 10 minutes to vote. Prince William County where I voted had three working voting machines (one broke immediately). It took me an hour and 45 minutes to vote at 6:30am. I was in a line with mostly black people. I turn on the local news at 10:00pm and there are still people in line - even though you had to be in line by 7pm to vote. The last votes were cast at about 11pm. It was complete and utter horseshit from the GOP led Virginia state government. I'm proud our citizens stuck it out with the lines though.Also from the study: ""16 percent of Obama voters waiting 30 minutes or more compared to 9 percent of Romney voters.  African-Americans and Hispanics were the likeliest to experience longer lines, at 22 percent and 24 percent respectively.""One experience isn't a tell all, but I'm in Kentucky and I only had to wait 30 seconds to vote.Let's use some critical thinking skills on this one:Rural areas tend to vote Republican. Rural areas have relatively fewer people.Urban areas tend to vote Democratic. Urban areas have relatively more people (to the point of overcrowding in many places).Knowing that one area has far fewer people than another area, which one would you expect to have longer wait times?ALF-CIO did a study? Yeah, that would never be biased!It seems our research has found that this study is plausible with no evidence to contradict it and some supporting evidence for it's findings, but no other studies or other research that directly confirms it.  Thus marking it ""Mostly true."""
285,"Cited articles in the link you provided:[Vote was astronomical for Obama in some Philadelphia wards] (http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20121108_Vote_was_astronomical_for_Obama_in_some_Philadelphia_wards.html)- From Philly.com, which says, ""Campbell is leader of West Philadelphia's Fourth Ward, where Obama received 9,955 votes. Romney? Just 55.""  That's 99.5% of the vote.Also, [Election Judge Wears Obama Hat in Obama's Home Ward] (http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/06/Election-Judge-Wears-Obama-Hat-in-Obama-s-Home-Ward)So we see no evidence to even suggest voter fraud in this precinct. And evidence that the turn out in that precinct while high, was not unusually so given the demographic makeup of the district, and others just like it. Until or unless anyone finds any reliable evidence to the contrary I am marking this false.That's not necessarily ""unusually high turnout"" - that's the people voting are voting for Obama, so I think the question is worded wrong. That being said, considering that [in a Wall Street Journal/ NBC poll Romney was polling around 0% with African Americans before the election](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13399788-nbcwsj-poll-heading-into-conventions-obama-has-four-point-lead?lite), this does not sound out of bounds, if this was a mostly Black precinct.The links to Philly.com article would seem to be about as close as we could hope for to verify the numbers (unless there's an official government page showing the numbers), but I think that without any further evidence it'd be impossible to know if there was any sort of fraud going on. As such, I'd think that the only way this claim could be labeled is **Unverifiable**.**Edit**: Incidentally, I found another precinct that went 99% for Obama: [City of Franklin Precinct 5](http://www.tidewaternews.com/2012/11/07/voting-broken-down-by-precincts/), which is apparently in Virginia.**Edit 2**: Further proof that extraordinarily high percentage in certain precincts is not out of the ordinary: in 2008 in North Carolina, Obama got 99% in four precincts in Charlotte and 1 in Salisbury ( [Source: Charlotte Observer](http://mellnik.net/ted/docs/2008/5A-1st-Nov06-State-Asection-05.pdf) ). Again, as with the current election, in 2008 this was in districts that were mostly black.With this being the case, I'd say that this claim is definitely **Unverifiable** at best, **False** at worst. There is no *proof* of fraud, and this isn't even unprecedented. More than anything this looks like a matter of simple demographics.Philadelphia resident here. Obama winning that percentage in a Philly precinct is not really that crazy. They don't even bother running republican candidates in most elections here. Across pretty much every demographic, it's a solidly blue city. If they dropped the anti-union crap they'd be more competitive in Philly.Thanks. :)In the Phily article it notes that ""In 13 Philadelphia wards, Obama received 99 percent of the vote or more.""  So it is not unique or unusual to ""one precinct.""  This alone seems to falsify the claim being asked to check if it was ""unusually high.""Here's another source:http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20121108_Vote_was_astronomical_for_Obama_in_some_Philadelphia_wards.htmlLook, I'll come right out and say it.  Identity politics is alive and well in this country (well, for almost everyone except white men).  Black people voted for Obama in 2008 at something like 95%.  Women vote for Democrats because of the so-called *War on Women*.  To have such a high rate for Obama among black people isn't shocking.  It's just plain sad."
286,"It is true that this election is nowhere near a landslide victory that the [1936](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1936), [1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964), and [1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1984) elections were. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't a mandate, because it really depends how you define ""mandate"".In 2004, Bush claimed his victory over Kerry was a mandate. Yet Bush [only had 286 electoral votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004), and in the popular vote he beat Kerry by only 2.4 percentage points. Obama, [by the current count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012), has 303 electoral votes, and beat Romney by 2 percentage points - a margin that is very likely to widen, as Florida is likely to fall to Obama, and the remaining votes to be counted in that state, as well as provisional ballots in states like Ohio, are likely to favor him as well.Was what Bush had actually a mandate? Many right-wing pundits seemed to think so, a lot of people on the left didn't, but Bush arguably governed from the position that it was, continuing to push the same agenda as his first term, including numerous positions on issues that were still highly unpopular.Is what Obama has a mandate? It really depends how you define ""mandate"", and how you interpret the vote. Different people will see it different ways, and I wouldn't be surprised to see many of the same people who argued that Bush's 2004 victory *was* a mandate arguing that Obama's 2012 victory *wasn't*, despite very similar numbers. So clearly, for many, the definition of ""mandate"" seems to be a political question more than a factual one.With this being the case, I'd rate this claim as **Half-True** or **Unverifiable**. It is absolutely correct in stating that this election is ""not even close"" to the elections of 1936, 1964, and 1984, but whether or not this means it isn't a mandate seems more of a matter of opinion than a matter of fact.**Edit**: Looks like Obama's lead has already grown to 2.2%. I predict that once it passes 2.4%, Republican pundits will start defining ""mandate"" as ""getting a higher percentage of the vote in your second election than you did in the first.""**Edit 2**: Relevant to the discussion, but probably not useful for the purpose of fact-checking (other than as anecdotal evidence), the Prime Minister of India's message congratulating Obama on his re-election [referred to it as a ""mandate""](http://pmindia.nic.in/press-details.php?nodeid=1535):>""Your mandate gives you a historic opportunity to continue to work for the welfare of the American people as also for global peace and progress at an admittedly difficult juncture, not just for the U.S., but indeed for the world at large.""there's no such thing as a mandate, that's another thing pundits invented to give themselves something to pontificate about.He claims that Obama's win ""isn't even close"" to a mandate, and then lists 3 of the most lopsided votes in US history and seems to say that if you don't pass those you aren't ""a mandate."" Would be curious to see how Obama's victory compares to all electoral and / or popular vote wins if that data is out there...**A close election, at the least, is a mandate for the Republicans to work with Obama.**Obama won by almost the identical margin by which Bush won in the 2004 election where Bush famously declared *he* had a ""mandate"". This is all political posturing nonsense.So, Mr. Hewwit is suggesting what? That Obama run again, and hope for a higher percentage of the popular vote? He should resign? He should attempt no policy initiatives due to this lack of mandate?No, Hugh Hewwit is what's typically known as a sore loser. Mandate comes from being elected president, not from a landslide.Current numbers have Obama winning by about 3 million votes. 50.4 percent to 48.1 percent of the popular vote. And still awaiting Florida to call the electoral college vote, but now it's: 303-206.http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/resultsAgreed with the observations that this is true on the election dates, but unverifiable on all the other statements. Thus unverifiable in it's core assertions.This doesn't directly answer the question, (esp. because I don't think presidential elections represent mandates and if they ever have, not in recent memory). But it's a good response to hearing people say ""mandate"" w.r.t. to any USPE in my opinion.I think the idea of the '84 mandate is a popular if misleading one. As early as '85 it was popular within some polisci circles to call the 1984 election a 'landslide without a mandate' because, 1) the 1984 campaign was (in)famously vague on what Reagan et al. meant by tax reform and deficit reduction, and 2), the divided 99th Congress was hamstrung by the beltway knowledge that they couldn't touch social security or defense spending (cf. David Stockman's account of the OMB's handicaps). And iirc, the guy who coined the term was himself a '64-type conservative.Some other comparables here:==Obama’s win was bigger than John Kennedy’s in 1960 (303 electoral votes, popular vote margin of 112,827), bigger than Richard Nixon’s in 1968 (301 electoral votes, popular vote plurlaity of 512,000), bigger than Jimmy Carter’s in 1976 (297 electoral votes, popular vote margin of 1,683,247), bigger than George W. Bush’s in 2000 (271 electoral votes and a popular vote loss of 543,816).http://www.thenation.com/blog/171085/obama-bigger-win-kennedy-nixon-carter-bush-or-bush#A mandate means you can push the people of the other party around because they are afraid of losing the next election. With that meaning we will see over time if Obama has a mandate."

And if we just simply go from when Obama took office to today, he has a net positive of 46,000 jobs created, which includes a net 739,000 part-time jobs *lost*. We have *more* full-time jobs today, and *fewer* part-time jobs.With this being the case, I'd label this claim as absolutely **False**.http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm> The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred toas involuntary part-time workers) fell by 269,000 to 8.3 million in October, partiallyoffsetting an increase of 582,000 in September. These individuals were working parttime because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find afull-time job. You can read the underemployed numbers in between the difference of U-5 and U-6.  Clicking on the spreadsheet in the gallup link [here](http://www.gallup.com/poll/125639/gallup-daily-workforce.aspx) will give you the rate of underemployment compared to the workforce since 2010, when the numbers started coming back up.  Seems to have either held steady or decreased as a percentage since early 2010.Since that doesn't go back quite far enough for my liking, [here](http://www.economytrack.org/underemployment.php) is a more robust graph that goes back beyond the recession.  It shows a rapid growth of underemployment during the recession, and then basically agrees with gallup, showing underemployment holding steady or gradually dropping through the end of 2010.Summary answer:  I suppose it comes down to semantics.  Is what the person said technically true?  Possibly, if you consider that many full-time jobs became part-time jobs during the recession, and consider those to be on Obama's administration.However, since the recession the underemployment rate has remained steady or dipped while Obama has added back all of the jobs we lost during the chunk of the recession that occurred under his administration and its aftermath, and then some.  So, in that sense, the person is wrong, because the jobs Obama added were not half underemployment, the large underemployment numbers are still the same underemployment percentages - and still the result of the recession.  Perhaps even more ""technically"" than above, Obama didn't ""add"" those large numbers of underemployment jobs - so no, half the jobs he added weren't underemployment.tl;dr - Yes and no, and your answer likely depends upon your understanding of the economy and whether you're a democrat or a republican.  I welcome rebuttals using facts and numbers.Great research here, marking this false."
288,"Judging from [the document they reference](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2012.pdf#page=235), it looks like these are projected premiums and deductibles if Congress passes legislation to increase the costs of Part B, which they consider a ""strong likelihood"".However, that assumes that not only will such legislation be passed, but that the increased costs will be passed on to the people enrolled in Medicare, rather than being paid for in some other way (such as through taxes, or additional savings made elsewhere.You'll also notice, looking at that table, that that dollar amount has consistently gone up every year (well, almost - it went down in 2012, as well as in 1996 and 1990). This is likely due at least in part to *inflation* and the increase in population covered by Medicare. Look back and see how much premiums and copays increased in the same timespan before Obama's presidency. You'll see they increased even *more*.The claim, as you post it, is probably **Mostly true**. It's based on legislation that hasn't been passed or even proposed yet, but still seems fairly likely. And although we don't know whether such legislation will be paid for in this way, looking at the history this would seem to be a fair assessment.*However*, the claim, in the context of the article you linked, deserves a rating of **Mostly false** or **Partisan bias**, because it blames this rise in prices on Obama's policies, despite that it is a continuation of a trend that existed well before Obama took office.So here's the question - do we rate claims based on how they're posted here, or based on the context with which they were originally made?The numbers are accurate go to 229 in [Here](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2012.pdf) However to make sense of the numbers and how accurate the projections are is another thing. I do see that there was a decrease from 2011 to 2012 so it may make the increase from 2012 to 2017 seems higher in a relative sense.I think we do mark this one as Partisan Bias, as even in this snippet it suggests that under current law or as the article lists ""Obama's Medicare plan..."" seniors pay more. When our research seems to show it was a trend predating Obama.Any statement that contains the word 'will' is probably unverifiable at least until it becomes 'did'.  Lots of iffy assumptions.  The Heritage Foundation did propose the individual health insurance mandate in the Clinton era so they can't be all bad."
289,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/12k9j6/bob_of_citizens_for_responsibility_and_ethics_in/This post should answer your question.Thanks! I briefly searched before posting but didn't see that.
290,"I only did a quick google search, and this [Wikipedia article ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_created_during_U.S._presidential_terms)seems to support her claim partially. Bush had a negative growth of 1,790 and Obama is at a positive 3,766 (I think this is in thousands). So overall, Obama has created more jobs than Bush, but it does not differentiate between public and private sector work.Is she talking about *net* jobs? If so, it's true, but it doesn't matter because it's more or less cherry-picking to compare a short piece of one president's term in which the most jobs were created to the entirety of another president's term. If she didn't say ""net"", then it's probably false. A whole ton of jobs were created under Bush (Most jobs associated with the Internet and clean energy were), and a whole ton were destroyed. Unless I missed a large piece of news, I doubt that anything happened during the past year to cause the gross creation of as many jobs as the maturation of the Internet.I apologize for not giving sources, but hopefully this gives you a good way to approach the fact-checking task and the importance of the difference between concepts like *net* and *gross*.There are two surveys of private sector jobs: the QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages) and CES (Current Employment Statstics).  The former is generally regarded as more accurate, but tends to be released some 5 or 6 months after the end of each quarter, so Boxer couldn't have been referring to its measure.So check out the [CES numbers](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0500000001) and expand the 'from' year dropdown, and find that national total private sector jobs were:December 2000: 111,677,000January 2001: 111,631,000December 2008: 111,824,000January 2009: 110,985,000So taking Dec 00-Dec 08 numbers, GWB's record is +143,000 private sector jobs, or Jan 01-Jan 09 numbers, -646,000.If Boxer made this statement about last Friday's BLS release which had the preliminary October 2012 number at 111,744,000.  Since the October 2011 number was at 109,781,000 that's an increase of +1,963,000 in the last 12 months.Since the changes are over a whole number of years you can also check out the [not seasonally adjusted numbers](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CEU0500000001) and find that GWB Dec-Dec is +189,000 and Jan-Jan -596,000; last 12 months +1,920,000.As you can see from the chart of the seasonally-adjusted numbers, the ""last 12 months"" window wouldn't give a very different value any time after the start of 2011.Any which way you parse it, it's not even close.  Boxer's claim is completely true.Business Insider: Avg # of jobs gained per month under Bush: 20,000Excluding 2002 and 2008 (which isn't fair, but showcases the best of the bush #s) jobs gained per month: 130,000Jobs gained under Obama per month (as of May): 131,000They claim the BLS as a source: [my source](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-05-06/news/31591072_1_job-creation-rate-obama-administration-mitt-romney)Source [bls.gov](http://data.bls.gov/pdq/querytool.jsp?survey=ce)Private sector Jobs created during Bush years (Jan 2001-Jan 2009) = -646,000Private sectors jobs created since Nov 2011 = 1.7M  True w/cherriesPrivate sector jobs created since Jan 2009 = 759,000.  True wo/cherries.I used 'seasonally adjusted' figures.  Using 'not seasonally adjusted' unfairly tips the scale in Obama's favor.Generally, the economy and job creation does much better during Democratic than Republican administrations. That has held true for a long time.But one problem with these statistics is that they don't count many people who are actually unemployed and looking for work.The whole question is a false premise if you ask me. What can a president do to increase private sector jobs? Why can't we get a president who admits before an election that there is only so much she can do and there are too many variables to give definitive promises of job growth?Politifact is biased. You can tell when Boxer said ""...were created..."" and Politifact uses net numbers instead of gains in the private sector. Either that or they go along with cherry picked data.without even reading the article, is this a net or a gross...? because that would be more important, don't you think?[removed]"

292,"There are several figures floating around on how much money the Romney's made off the deal, but it is between $15-115m. And all we know for the initial investment is that it was more than $1 million.The money that they made from the auto bailout came though the Romneys' positions in Delphi though their investment in Elliot Managment, Paul Singer's hedge fund. Delphi used to be Delco Auto Parts, GM's proprietary parts supplier (think Mopar and Chrysler) and was spun off from its parent company in 1999. By 2005 the company was in the throws of bankruptcy, and in came the ""vulture-funds"" including Elliot Management. SEC filings show that hedge funds used their ownership of Delphi's debt to buy up the stock of the company for a scant 67 cents per share, and this was in 2009 as the auto bailout negotiations were in full swing.It is estimated that the U.S. taxpayers bailed out Delphi to a tune of $12.9 billon. After the bailout Delphi executives, now under complete control of their hedge fund bosses, extorted payments from GM/U.S. Treasury by threatening to shut down operations, which would have put General Motors out of business for lack of parts, and likely Chrysler as well. Since the hedge fund managers took control of Delphi they have fired 25,200 union employees, and shuttered 25 of 29 factories, reincorporated Delphi overseas, and outsourced production to China. The hedge fund managers put the icing on the coup d'etat cake by running advertisements blaming Obama's auto bailout for the loss of jobs and pensions by the former employees.So all that awful stuff aside, did the Romney's make money from Delphi vis-a-vis the auto bailout? Yes, but it also has a lot to do with the types of people who were managing their investment and managing Delphi. The Romney's were invested in Delphi before it went public, so they got the absurdly low price per share that the hedge fund managers enjoyed, it now trades at $32.82. For each million the Romneys invested with Elliot Management their return would have been $15.3 million. We don't know how much they made off the deal because 1) We don't have the tax return data 2) Much of their initial investment is still tied up in Elliot Managment's accounts. Romneys' Federal Investment Disclosure: http://www.thenation.com/sites/default/files/Romney%20federal%20disclosure.pdfThe Nation article on the in's and out's of the deal:http://www.thenation.com/article/170644/mitt-romneys-bailout-bonanza# The Hill article on the deal:http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/automobiles/262839-report-romney-profited-153-million-on-auto-bailout-I can confirm that the complaint is filed.I'd call this unverifiable until litigated/investigated thoroughly (which def. won't happen).  We can assume Romney's actions were unsavory (which I do) but can't conclude anything as of yet.  Otherwise, I enjoyed orangsconcierge's sleuthing."
293,"Given that the same jobs report said that 171,000 jobs were added, but that the unemployment rate went from 7.8 to 7.9, this seems to me like a reasonable assumption. If there weren't more people who joined the job market, I'm not sure how else you could explain how the number of jobs went up but unemployment rates went up as well.This isn't a fact-check, per se... more along the lines of ""I'm not sure how else you could read those statistics"".source [BLS.gov](bls.gov)1.

294,"It's an exaggerated statement to say he didn't pay taxes for 15 years. The trust money is eventually taxed and the only accounts for how part of Romney's money is taxed. Bloomberg's source seems to be the CRUT's filings from 2007-2011 obtained from the IRS.Romney used a tax loophole to have money gain interest untaxed, sort of like an IRA. When he's paid money from the trust, that money is taxed.This kind of loophole was closed a few years ago but those already exploiting it with CRUTs were allowed to keep them open. EDIT: Removed the word ""legal"" as some seemed to be confusing it as the point of the comment. Also added info that the money in question relates to only part of Romney's wealth for clarity.Thank you all!I wonder: Is this part of Romney's tithing, or is it above his tithing?So what do folks think here: Unverifiable?If that info exists, it would probably be findable on the Citizens for Tax Justice site..http://www.ctj.orgUnless he releases his tax returns I don't know if this can be verified, as far as I am aware he is still hiding them.OP wants to know if it is true that Romney used legal means to pay almost no income taxes.Shifting this discussion to a straw man about it being legal is not answering the question. Can someone please answer as the top answer talks about the legality and what Romney did, not actually how this affected how much Romney paid?"
295,"Anytime you have, ""anecdotal"" ""intangible"" and ""give the sense"" in the same sentence, any possibility for assessing accuracy goes out the window and should raise big red flags. Glad you're asking this question.There are, I think, two claims to be addressed here. The first is that ""the odds favor Mr. Romney.""When it comes to assessing the real world with facts, really the only numbers that are out there are poll numbers. And, despite what commentators like Mr. Rove would have you believe, the polling has actually been extraordinarily clear. Mr. Romney has never led President Obama in Ohio, and his chances of winning the Electoral College without Ohio are vanishingly small. (He would have to win Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire, Colorado and either Nevada or Wisconsin--presuming President Obama otherwise holds on to the other states Senator Kerry won in 04.) If Romney was polling better in Ohio--or, for that matter, Wisconsin, Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire or Colorado--Mr. Rove's ""anecdotal and intangible"" ""evidence"" might be valid and/or meaningful. As such, though, and given that this subreddit is about discerning fact from fiction, Mr. Rove seems wrong. **tl;dr I'd rate this claim: False.**In terms of the question about crowd size, specifically, that's a really interesting thing to write given that the President hasn't held any campaign stops in the last two days, while Romney has. So, I guess, technically that's true over the last few days. But in terms of the last month, I didn't see any major articles in the news (per a search on both Google and Bing) comparing or contrasting the two. If the advantage were as large as Mr. Rove seems to be conveying, you'd think that there'd be some coverage.In fact, the only article I could really find was about how the Romney campaign photoshopped an image to make the crowd size appear larger than it actually was:http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/romney-campaign-appears-to-exaggerate-size-of-nevaNow, technically speaking, Mr. Rove wrote that these intangibles ""give the sense"" which is obviously a subjective, rather than objective, experience. But frankly, these intangibles are beside the point. Whether or not Romney and Ryan have larger crowd sizes does not indicate that they have momentum. **tl;dr I'd rate this claim: False.**Intangible evidence is an oxymoron.And crowd aren't necessarily indicative. Romney base could be more passionate or my likely to go to a rally, but smaller overall.On the issue of crowd size, Ron Paul had large crowds but still lost the primary. I am not a Ron Paul fan, just thought it was a good counter argument.During the primaries, Ron Paul had the far and away the biggest rallies out of any other candidate.  And we all know how that turned out.Pure hearesay, but may give us clues to find real sourced crowd sizes: ""The largest crowd I've read of so far is 30,000 for Obama in Madison the day after the debate - not bad for the lowest day of the campaign. I've not heard of anything bigger than 15,000 for Romney, on the same day.""Also here is this source about Romney crowds at 15,000 at this point:http://nation.foxnews.com/2012-election/2012/08/13/obama-camp-panics-over-romney-crowd-sizeThe very specfic - and I'd think checkable - fact claim I was trying to focus on here is that Romney's crowds are in a meaningful way larger than Obama's now. Anyone have numbers on those?This question would be sort of fine without the Rove part. Rove is a paid uber-shill and Republican grand string puller citing anecdotal and intangible supposed evidence and personal impressions of that information's meaning to describe his personal opinion. If there is any way to reliably measure crowd sizes, there's no way to say what that means and no justification for saying it means what Rove says it means.30K at this rally for Obama: http://www.leadertelegram.com/news/daily_updates/article_764781c4-0eaf-11e2-9aef-0019bb2963f4.htmlAnd I'm told that Romney's rally tonight, is his largest to date, also at 30K, but I don't have a source on that yet.Jake Taper notes Obama's crowd today at 20K. https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/264867781286178816Finding it hard to source exact sizes of rallies, but both camps seem to be able to bring in roughly 20-30K people crowds in similar states. I'm marking this false unless new evidence comes in showing a disparity.Something else to consider: How many of the people at Romney/Ryan rallies are getting paid to be there?"
296,"It would seem the idea Obama floated was not about creating a new position but about consolidating existing ones. In essence attempting to lessen bureacracy:""I’ve said that I want to consolidate a whole bunch of government agencies. We should have one secretary of Business, instead of nine different departments that are dealing with things like giving loans to SBA [the Small Business Administration] or helping companies with exports,"" he said in an interview with MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski.""http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/economy/264587-obama-calls-for-a-secretary-of-business**Claims:** 1. President Obama would create another Cabinet-level position (and thereby department) of Secretary of Business. 2. The American economy is struggling and government welfare spending is at a record high and this spending/welfare is a result of President Obama's policies, and his solution is to expand government and add more bureaucrats and government offices.**Background:**According to the [Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/10/29/obama-suggests-secretary-of-business-in-a-second-term/) President Obama said in an MSNBC interview that aired Monday:>“We should have one Secretary of Business, instead of nine different departments that are dealing with things like giving loans to SBA or helping companies with exports,” [...] “There should be a one-stop shop.”Further, from that same WSJ article:>Mr. Obama blamed Congress for such consolidation not happening during his first term because lawmakers have been “very protective about not giving up their jurisdiction over various pieces of government.”Per the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/adwatch-romney-ad-on-obamas-proposal-for-secretary-of-business-is-misleading/2012/11/01/9f60fa64-2457-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html):>Back in January, Obama had suggested collapsing six economic agencies into one, an election-year idea intended to halt bureaucratic nightmares and force Republicans to back him on one of their own favorite issues. He was seeking more power to shrink the government.>Obama asked Congress to give him a kind of reorganization power to guarantee the president a vote, within 90 days, on any idea he offered to consolidate agencies, provided it would save money and cut the size of government.>Obama said he wanted to merge six major trade and commerce agencies into a one-stop-shopping department for businesses. He was seeking to counter charges by Romney and other Republicans that he has presided over the kind of regulation, spending and debt that can undermine the economy.**Analysis:**It's disingenuous to imply that this proposal would ""add another bureaucrat,"" because the Small Business Administration already exists, and President Obama is proposing to *elevate* that to a Cabinet-level department/position and to perhaps rename it as simply the Department of Business or some such. Further, because President Obama is proposing to consolidate a number of governmental departments in to a ""one-stop shop,"" again, it seems disingenuous to imply that this is ""adding another bureaucrat,"" especially as Mr. Romney has made consolidation of government a major part of his campaign. Renaming and/or elevating different Secretaries or Departments/Administrations to Cabinet-level is hardly something new or extraordinary. Mr. Obama has made clear he would not be ""creating"" a new bureaucrat, but elevating an existing one, while actively *consolidating* a number of different departments in to a ""one-stop shop."" **tl;dr I'd rate this claim: Mostly False.**And this from AP:""Romney’s ad provides a misleading portrayal of Obama’s proposal for a secretary of business, suggesting the president is bent on expanding government by adding another bureaucrat. It also ignores recent positive news about the economy.Contrary to the ad’s assertion, Obama suggested consolidating nine agencies that deal with business issues as a way of streamlining the federal bureaucracy. He mentioned the idea in a recent interview on MSNBC.Back in January, Obama had suggested collapsing six economic agencies into one, an election-year idea intended to halt bureaucratic nightmares and force Republicans to back him on one of their own favorite issues. He was seeking more power to shrink the government.""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/adwatch-romney-ad-on-obamas-proposal-for-secretary-of-business-is-misleading/2012/11/01/9f60fa64-2457-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.htmlClearly, he's making a blanket statement that Obama wants to bureaucratize everything, hoping you'll fill in the gap and say, ""Obama wants to regulate *blank*, but I like *blank*."""
297,"Also here:http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-making-of-romneys-storm-relief-eventI'd say mostly true.The only thing I disagree with is the claim (seemingly agreed to by the upvotes in that comment thread) that there was no effort to involve the Red Cross.  (A half-assed effort, maybe, but the whole thing was impromtu.)Two projectors instructing people to ""Text Red Cross to 90999 to make a $10 donation"" were confirmed by [the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/30/mixed-messages-at-romney-storm-relief-event-in-ohio/) and the [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/Ari_Shapiro/status/263289855499436032/photo/1) of Ari Shapiro (NPR).The WP also reports those projectors ran Romney campaign videos, but I don't think anyone is really contesting that this was something other than a campaign stunt.  Another [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/263278575237615616/photo/1/large) shows signage for a ""campaign rally"", not a ""relief event"".But the Romney bus, indeed, made the 5k Walmart run.  And then they staged photos.  And piles of food cans make for a more picturesque pitch-in-and-help relief effort than two projectors reading TEXT 99909.The attendees re-giving the stuff Romney bought may be a bit overblown.  All they wanted to do was see Romney and some volunteers said they needed to bring a canned good.  They weren't necessarily aware the event had been re-billed as a charity event; it was all done last-minute.  People didn't bring donations and the Red Cross wasn't exactly prepared (or even notified, possibly) to absorb and distribute those donations.So the donated goods may be on the Romney bus, they might be distributed locally.  They might have been left in the gymnasium for the school to clean up (they do say in the Buzzfeed article much of the stagecraft had been left behind), or maybe the donations will end up being distributed locally to churches and food banks... can't verify.In the other Atlantic story linked from the Atlantic story above, they mention Paul Ryan saying to Floridians that [his campaign offices are continuing to gather relief supplies](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/whats-difference-between-romney-relief-event-and-regular-campaign-stop/58501/).  So the campaign stop -slash- relief effort theme is likely to continue through to election day.If the reporting is correct, it's obvious this is true.Additional refs:http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/10/31/1115011/romney-campaign-staged-donations-in-storm-relief-event/http://themoderatevoice.com/166042/report-part-of-romneys-storm-relief-rally-was-pure-photo-op/http://www.coloradoconnection.com/news/politics/story.aspx?id=819723http://truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/item/17612-romney-s-hurricane-relief-effort-was-as-fake-as-ryan-s-soup-kitchen-photo-ophttp://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-making-of-romneys-storm-relief-eventhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/10/31/romney-campaign-looks-for-any-port-in-a-stormThe most damning evidence reported is that people who showed up to donate with no donations were given donations from the 'display table', a table setup by Romney's campaign and filled with items bought at Wal-Mart, so the donors could feel good (and thus, likely, offer support to Romney's campaign).There are 2 parts to this: 1. that he bought to give to his supporters to give away2. the red cross does not accept physical donationsfor part one- the article only mentions teen boyspart two - Local chapters of the red cross do accept physical donations http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/news/local_news/red-cross-accepting-donations-for-storm-victims http://www.redcross.org/nj/fairfield/programs-services/food-pantry  Its called the red cross food pantry. They are managed by local chapters. ""The pantry appreciates donations of food and supermarket gift cards. If you would like to make a donation to the Food Pantry, please call (973) 797-3300.""So if he contacted a local Red Cross they would likely say they were accepting food, water, and other donations. To quote him directly “Whatever the Red Cross is willing to accept we’ll be shipping to them,” he said. “At this point, they’re not willing to put a limit on what they’re willing to accept.”But when I post this info (directly from the red cross) It gets downvoted to oblivion because of the false assumption that I support Romney.Don't forget also that we have no confirmation *where* the money came from, whether it was the campaign (which I imagine would be a tricky legal issue), or Romney's pocket, or a donor, or what.Hmmm. So it seems we have only a single source on this. What do folks think? ""unverfiable?"" ""half true""? Other?I'm considering this one ""unverifiable"" as we seem to only have the single buzzfeed source as evidence thus far. And even though i see no signs of this being an unrliable source -  we have no confirmation from other reporting, and only a vague confirmation in the buzzfeed story from the Romney campaign.[deleted][deleted]Was still hoping for another source other than buzzfeed, which tends to be where are the other articles including the atlanticwire were sourced."
298,"Really you should just be looking at the internal numbers of the report cited in the original article. Plenty of numbers and figures. I think the [DailyKos piece](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/07/20/885549/-How-much-do-we-REALLY-spend-on-Welfare) is worth glancing at, too, to help understand that even though it's easy to use a phrase like ""means-tested welfare programs"" and think that that's being very specific, it's not actually.You also need to be careful in how you define ""welfare,"" because in the report things like the Earned Income Tax Credit (i.e. lower taxes for the working poor) are cited as welfare, but I doubt few people believe that lower taxes for poor people is welfare in the conventional sense.In addition, if you take a closer look, the healthcare category accounts for nearly half of all the spending. Don't forget that a huge amount of Medicaid spending is on the elderly. Do we really consider Medicaid spending for our elderly as welfare? Further, while $60k definitely sounds like a lot, when you consider that those living under the poverty line are *also* likely to have considerably more children, $60k for a household doesn't mean they're rolling in dough. Last point I'll make is this. If you look at the four years preceding FY2011, you'll see that there's a huge jump from FY08 to FY09. The reason that's the case is because unemployment has skyrocketed. I'm not sure why people are surprised that our spending on means-tested welfare programs has increased. Fewer people have work, which means that fewer people have money. The social safety net is doing what it's supposed to do right now.tl;dr I'd rate this claim: ""Mostly True, but requires context""If they are counting Social Security and Medicare, a portion of that money goes to people who have a high net worth and don't need it.  For example, my father, who is retired, draws two pensions, made several hundred thousand dollars on tech stocks in the 90s and oughts (betting on companies that my brother and I told him to invest in ... Oracle, Google, Apple), is married to a woman who is less than 65 and makes about $70k a year, he is covered on her insurance, maintains his own insurance, and still works part-time at the gated community where he lives, and owns his house free and clear.  He draws on Social Security and Medicare.  He also just bought a $38,000 pickup truck, his wife owns a $45,000 car, and they own a $50,000 van.  He still holds several hundred thousand dollars in stock.I have a feeling he will vote for Romney because he doesn't want his taxes to go up, and would rather they go down, because he really doesn't have many deductions anyway.He also doesn't seem to care whether Social Security and Medicare will be there for his children.There were 46.2 million people in poverty in 2010 * 60K =2.52 Trillion. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/07/20/885549/-How-much-do-we-REALLY-spend-on-Welfareis probably biased, but puts it at 5-12% of the budget. Which is -not- 2.52 trillion.I say The Falses. EDIT: Your title is wrong in that the article says for each -household- not each person. So, it's less wrong. I think it's just a matter of what you think welfare is. People who want less spending lump more into it because it's easy to propagandize against it. The government doesn't have a ""welfare"" budget column, so people can pick and choose what they want to call welfare for political reasons. So... maybe instead of a ""False"" a, ""Depending on One's Own Point of View"", Obi-Wan style.Welfare is a difficult issue to pick apart. Welfare specifically refers to a program called TANF. People are generally on TANF for a short period of time. Contrary to the perception, very few people spend their whole life on  welfare. In fact, one is allowed only 5 years of benefits in a lifetime. There are many other programs that get lumped into the generic description of welfare. This is an [article](http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/PA694.pdf) from the cato institute about the size of the welfare state. If you scroll to the appendix at the bottom you see that they use a very, very broad definition of welfare. For example, the school lunch program, pell grants and medicaid to name a few are all considered welfare according to Cato. Whether or not these things are ""welfare"" is left up to reader. Personally, I think that organizations like the Heritage foundation and Cato use too broad of a definition. Libertarians would argue the opposite. I think its safe to say that if you look at their list of ""welfare"" programs that its pretty obvious that the majority of americans, including some Cato readers have or will use welfare at one time or another.My parents are on disability, and together they make around 40k a year. My mom only makes 10k of that.So what do folks think here? Mostly true? Half true? Less?Yesterday I read that it was 59 billion total on social programs.. here.. (They compare it to 92 billion in corporate welfare)http://ctj.org/ctjinthenews/2012/09/ironton_tribune_looking_at_47_percent_victims.phpIn this chart http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htmthey show that in 2009, the total spent on a number of Federal departments - which presumably includes the money they administer is 789 billion. But I think the first figure is more realistic."
299,"Here is an article at TPM the claims this process for ""if the sequester came directly from Obama"" part of this question:===""The history here is much different and much more complicated. Boehner himself touched off the debt limit standoff by demanding that Congress match each dollar provided in new borrowing authority with a dollar of cuts to federal spending. President Obama was content to use the debt limit as a forcing mechanism to bring down 10-year deficits, but he wanted a deal that included tax revenue, and one that raised the debt limit enough to prevent the brinksmanship from returning ahead of the election. In the end, the parties were only able to agree on $1 trillion worth of cuts to discretionary spending. Under the Boehner rule that would’ve teed up a new debt limit crisis in the middle of the 2012 election. So leaders of both parties agreed to set up a process that would allow Congress to fast track legislation to reduce the deficit, ideally by at least $1.2 trillion. To make sure members came to agreement, both parties, including Boehner, agreed to include an enforcement mechanism that Republicans and Democrats found equally unappealing.This ultimately resulted in what we now know as the sequester. But before Congress and the White House settled on this particular configuration, they batted around a bunch of other ideas. Among others, Republicans tried to include partial repeal of the health care law, and Democrats tried to include the expiration of the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy. The sequester facing the country today was the result of a long bipartisan negotiation to avoid last year’s default crisis and prevent one from re-emerging in the chaos of an election year.Back in November, Boehner accepted partial ownership.“I would feel bound by it,” he said. “It was part of the agreement. And so either we succeed or we are in the sequester. The sequester is ugly. Why? Because we don’t want anybody to go there. That’s why we have to succeed.”  http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/07/republicans-want-off-the-hook-for-voting-for-defense-sequester.php""The [Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012](http://www.scribd.com/doc/105938112/White-House-Sequestration-Report) (STA) (P.L. 112-155) requires the President to submit to Congress a report on the potential sequestration triggered by the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose, and Congress to enact, a plan to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion, as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA)."" ~ Executive Office of the POTUSThe sequester is a White House proposal, Congress agreed to it, and the figure is [$878](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/29/fema-loses-nearly-900-million-if-sequester-cuts-hit/) million:  [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/obamas-fanciful-claim-that-congress-proposed-the-sequester/2012/10/25/8651dc6a-1eed-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_blog.html)[removed]"
300,"This isn't really a ""checkable"" claim, but here's some info for you:[LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-presidential-debate-romney-education-20121016,0,5870616.story) points out that while Massachusetts schools are indeed exemplary, this is undoubtedly in part due to initiatives put into place before Romney took office (Particularly, notes The Boston Globe, [the Education Reform Act of 1993](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2012/10/14/mitt-romney-surges-also-expresses-pride-massachusetts/REhJOMdgAb9Hbq3DZnonUI/story.html)), in part because their schools receive generous funding, and in part because Massachusetts has a ""less challenging"" student population. In fact, The Boston Globe seems to cite as his primary accomplishment in this area his success at preventing attempts to change Massachusetts' education system.So take it how you like it. The state had great schools when he came in, and he succeeded in keeping them that way. How much of an accomplishment this is is probably a matter of opinion.Are there some specific claims you would like us to verify? We'd be happy to check more and specifically vet some claims of education performance during the Romney administration and suss out their connection to specific policies as much as possible.If you read his Wikipedia page you will see that he kept trying to push more legislation through which would increase funding for schools but it was mostly blocked by the state congress.Ma was #1 before and after mitt, so this is somehow an achivement"
301,"Can you give us an actual fact claim to check? This is pretty broad. Perhaps paste in exact quotes from your friends' facebook pages?I think the dots that the GOP are connecting are as follows...-Fox News released emails they obtained that were going around during the attack on the embassy.  These emails referenced that a terrorist group was claiming responsibility for the attack on their Facebook page.[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2012/10/24/internal-emails-on-libya-terror-attack/)-Before these emails were released, the Obama administration was saying they weren't aware of the reason for the attack or that they were blaming it on the anti-Muslim film that was being released by a fundamentalist Christian group here in America.[The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/12/benghazi-attack-us-officials-consulate)[ABC News](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/16/13896494-ambassador-rice-benghazi-attack-began-spontaneously?lite)I think this is where the disconnect comes from.  The administration's line was suggesting it was anti-Muslim hate, FOX finds these emails suggesting they may have known who was responsible which had nothing to do necessarily with the anti-Muslim film (or was not as critical of a contributor as the administration believed).They take that a step further then, believing he's either...-in league with Muslim extremists-making us all multicultural and ""we can't judge them because of x, y, and z"", which in their eyes is tacit approval of terrorism-showing weakness on our part, blaming/persecuting Christians and blasting our freedom of speech without adequately condemning the terrorist attacksI'm not sure what you could label this as though.  I mean, it stands to reason that before you start blaming groups and bombing countries, you figure out who's responsible.  Unverifiable, maybe a case could be made for Partisan Bias, might be best?  There are a lot of moving parts here, some of which we probably won't be allowed to know (national security and all that), that might make proving this hard.To the OP, on a less fact-checky note, suggest to your conservative friends that it's OK to blame Obama for this if they hold Bush to the deaths on 9/11 as he ignored months of reports saying that Bin Laden was ready to attack us.  They believed AQ's planned attack was a smokescreen to distract us from attacking Saddam Hussein.[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/new-report-shows-how-many-warnings-about-bin-laden-were-ignored-by-the-bush-white-house-2012-9)They are also claiming that Obama watched the whole attack from the situation room and did nothing to intervene.http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/28/Report-Obama-Watched-Benghazi-Attack-From-Situation-RoomCondi Rice said on Fox that Fox should back off the hysteria until the facts are known.  Geraldo Rivera told the Fox folks to back off.  The father of the dead ambassador asked that his son's death not be politicized.  The mother of the dead former SEAL asked that her son's death not be politicized.  Fox is trying to politize the deaths of four Americans for gain and it is disgusting.This is going to be hard to verify as you have to determine (1) what was known by the President and then (2) did he attempt to hide what he knew from the public or present an alternative theory.I think some of this information is starting to filter out but I doubt that if the President was willing to engage in a ""cover-up"" he is going to do anything to tip his hand about what he knew until well after the election.The inter-agency fallout is something interesting to watch.Hmmm. Not sure how to Fact-flair this one. I think we've helped here, but not positive there was one true claim to verify or debunk either way here. Maybe ""unverifiable""? What do folks think?Others have offered explanations, but there is one thing that you could explain to them, namely the difference between a [seal](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/seal-versus-sea-lion-1.jpg) and a [SEAL](http://www.special-ops.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/navy-seals1.jpg) (older picture, but you get the idea).A. There is no embassy in Benghazi, the Libyan embassy is in Tripoli.  B: Even if everything the right wing people say is true, the Benghazi attack is literally a thousand times less severe than the faulty intelligence, $1T, 4500 dead, terrorist recruiting, war in Iraq."
302,"These three articles ([one](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/28/mitt-romney-fema_n_2036198.html?ref=topbar), [two](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/10/did_mitt_say_hed_shut_down_fema.php?ref=fpblg), [three](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/29/romney_s_fema_cuts.html) ) show a video of Mitt Romney during the New Hampshire GOP Debate (13-June-2011). In it, he gives no definitive answer concerning privatizing FEMA (all of the articles mentioned do not show the full debate. [Here's the full video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=NL_ssmQZRDI#t=708s), and his response [from the official transcript](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1106/13/se.02.html) ):>KING: What else, Governor Romney? You've been a chief executive of a state. I was just in Joplin, Missouri. I've been in Mississippi and Louisiana and Tennessee and other communities dealing with whether it's the tornadoes, the flooding, and worse. FEMA is about to run out of money, and there are some people who say do it on a case-by-case basis and some people who say, you know, maybe we're learning a lesson here that the states should take on more of this role. How do you deal with something like that?>ROMNEY: Absolutely. Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in. We cannot...>KING: Including disaster relief, though?>ROMNEY: We cannot -- we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.It appears that he's in favor of cutting government spending on disaster relief, and allowing the states to have more power in organizing a response. He then starts talking about the national debt, and its impact on the future.According to [his website](http://www.mittromney.com/collection/smaller-smarter-simpler-government):>Mitt will work toward balancing the budget, reducing the size and reach of the federal government, and returning power to the states and the people.While there's no indication that he'd completely privatize or demolish FEMA, it appears he'd be in favor of cutting spending.I'd rate this **Mostly True**.EDIT: There was mention online of an official response concerning Romney's plan for emergency relief, but I haven't been able to find the full response and I've gotta get back to work. Anyone?Not sure this clarifies things but Camp Romney now added this:“Gov. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions,” Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement. “As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA.”A campaign official added that Romney would not abolish FEMA.""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/83001.html#ixzz2AiDaWH20And here is this article on the same question: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/10/did_mitt_say_hed_shut_down_fema.php?ref=fpblgAnd another: http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/29/romney_s_fema_cuts.html  which also covers other statements and proposed Federal budgets from Team Romney.Unless folks think differently, I think GGreyson got it right: mostly true. He seems to be against ""shuttering"" it, but strongly for moving it down to the States, and even considering privatizing as much as possible.Probably not but it is a great idea"

The question as worded has nothing to do with how much was received by each firm.According to this:So just how many federally-funded energy companies have failed?A total of five have gone bankrupt, according to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. All of the failed companies that the Committee identified came from just two programs that received significant dollar amounts from the Department of Energy. Those two programs funded 63 firms.

That's a failure rate of about 8%. http://www.kxly.com/news/money/Obama-s-alternative-energy-bankruptcies/-/116108/17078304/-/bc860/-/index.htmlI'm marking the idea that half of green energy companies invested in by the Obama admin are shuttered as false, based on the sourcing I just found.[This factcheck.org article](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/romneys-clean-energy-whoppers/) concludes:> Romney said a lot about the $90 billion in stimulus spending on clean energy — and very little of it was accurate."

(From Wikipedia)  Francois Choquette: François Choquette (born 1974) is a Canadian politician, who was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 2011 election. He represents the electoral district of Drummond as a member of the New Democratic Party.Prior to being elected, Choquette was a teacher. Choquette has a Bachelor's degree in secondary education in French and history and a Master's degree in literature.* This guy would not be a reliable source for a statistical analysis.James Johnson: James A. Johnson (born December 24, 1943) is a United States Democratic Party political figure, and the former CEO of Fannie Mae. He was the campaign manager for Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid and chaired the vice presidential selection committee for the presidential campaign of John Kerry. He briefly led the vice-presidential selection process for the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama.Johnson received a B.A. in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1966, and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1968.* Definite bias, but may be able to wrangle some numbers competently.On to the study:  The main problem here is that there is no comparison to past vote counts, or explanation of what a normal vote count should look like.

All programming of the machines, diagnostic testing, and vote tabulation is done by elections staff in each county""This is clearly untrue. The machines have code in them already; whatever is done by the elections staff must be done in whatever software that was provided. If this software lies, in theory it could be detected with a recount - but that is assuming there is a recount, and it works properly (see end).""it would be impossible for someone to access the company's machines from a remote location and interfere with its results.""This assumes that the malicious code isn't on the computers already. The claim was that the manufacturer has ties to the republican party, and is trying to subvert the vote - this does not need any remote access. Additionally, the computers can be accessed directly, and presumably are networked so tabulation can happen at each precinct; this means that a person can tamper with them on site.Again, recounts could catch these types of hacking, but that assumes there is a recount. And I am unclear about what happens to the physical ballots, and whether they are tied to anything; it's very easy for a program to misprint ballots, so if they are printed after a vote is cast, it may not make any difference.FalseIt's not only possible.

If the machines in certain locales go down, increasing wait times substantially, is that ""altering""?

308,"[This](http://notworkingforiowa.com/) appears to be the source of the claim, as far as I can tell. Still not sure whether or not it's true. Still looking into it.**Edit**: Okay, I have more information, but it's kinda' all over the place.Of the votes referenced in the website I cited, one ([Roll Call 139](http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Votes/house/2012/139/)) doesn't appear to have anything to do with the VAWA. The other, ([Roll Call 255](http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Votes/house/2012/255/)) was one that *did* pertain to the Act and that King *did* vote against... along with every Democrat in the House of Representatives. In fact, King and fellow Republican Diane Black were the only two Republicans to vote ""No"" alongside all of the Democrats.For the final vote on passing the bill ([roll call 258](http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Votes/house/2012/258/)), King voted in favor of passing it. Most Republicans favored it and most Democrats opposed it.There is apparently some degree of legislative complexity behind all of this. Apparently there were a few different versions of the bill before it was passed, and [one would protect gays and offer illegal immigrants temporary VISAs](http://votesmart.org/public-statement/695118/violence-against-women-reauthorization-act#.UIhiTFak_To), and one that didn't. It looks like King's vote(s?) in opposition to the bill pertain to the way it was being pushed through, and likely also because of the added protections in the version of the bill he didn't support. And when he finally voted [in favor of](http://steveking.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4411&Itemid=300100) the bill, he did it with reservations about the process involving it.I'm still not very clear on the details on this, but given how muddy and apparently complex this is, I'd be inclined to say this is either **Partisan Bias**, **Half-True**, or even **Mostly False**."

And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried—and failed—to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.Initial Google search sent me to [CNN's fact-checking] (http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/23/politics/fact-check-iraq/index.html) of the debate. Through the article I found [this transcript](http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2011/12/18/mitt-romney-beating-back-gingrich-surge#p//v/1334579161001) of an interview that Romney gave on *Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.* Note that the interview didn't happen a few weeks ago, but in **December 2011.**I've quoted the related question and answer, as well as bolded the specific portion regarding troop numbers. >WALLACE: And we're back now with Governor Mitt Romney.>Governor, the final U.S. troops are leaving Iraq over the next two weeks.>Couple of questions -- first of all, looking back, and hindsight is always 20/20, should we have invaded? And secondly, big picture -- what should we have done differently over the nine years there?>ROMNEY: Oh, boy. That's a big question. And going back and trying to say given what we know now, what will we have done? Would we have invaded or not?>At that time, we didn't have the knowledge that we have now. At that time, Saddam Hussein was hiding. He was not letting the inspectors from the United Nations into the various places that they wanted to go. The IAEA was blocked from going into the palaces and so forth. And the intelligence in our nation and other nations was that this tyrant had weapons of mass destruction.>And in the light of that -- that belief, we took action which was appropriate at the time. Lessons learned along the way, you know, I think our military would say a lot of lessons learned. We probably should have gone in, going in with a heavier footprint.>I think there was a sense that when -- when on the ship it said ""mission accomplished,"" that the mission had been accomplished. It turns out it was just getting started and we had to pursue a surge very late in the process.>The surge was successful. And fortunately, we've now been able to pull our troops out. We're, of course, very happy to see our troops come out.>**But I think you're going to see another lesson learned. I think we're going to find that this president by not putting in place a status in forces agreement with the Iraqi leadership has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and we should have left 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqis' own military capabilities.**>I'm very concerned in this setting. I hope it works out. But I'm concerned.As indicated from dgeiser13's post of the pertinent part of the transcript, it would seem that the quote in the thread title is incorrect. Obama did not say that Romney wanted to **put** more troops in Iraq, only that we should have more troops in Iraq right now.It's a small change, but enough that it completely changes the nature of the claim - from one saying that Romney thought the troops should have never left to one implying that Romney thinks that we should increase troop levels in Iraq again.The original claim, as stated by Obama, was dubious at best. Romney apparently questioned the speed and extent of the withdrawal, but never explicitly said that as of the time in question that there should be more troops in Iraq. So Obama's claim would probably be **Mostly False**.However, as this post apparently seeks a claim about something Obama never actually said, it's hard to assign a value to this claim, as it doesn't accurately reflect the claim at its source."

There were 342 total active ships as of April 6, 1917, when the U.S. entered World War I. There were 282 active duty ships as of April 2012, according to a Congressional Research Service report in August. That’s down from the Naval History and Heritage Command’s count of 285 as of September 2011. However, 282 ships is the same number in service during George W. Bush’s last year in office, and a slight increase over the number in 2007, when the size of the fleet was actually at its lowest.""http://factcheck.org/2012/10/false-claims-in-final-debate/[True]( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-navy-smallest-1917-air-force-s/). But, the capabilities of each of those ships has increased tremendously, so using the number of ships as an indicator of military strength is wrong.  Quality > QuantityAnd also this:In 1916, the US controlled roughly 11% of the world’s naval power. This is an impressive number that ranks the US third in naval strength behind the UK (34%) and Germany (19%), and just ahead of France (10%). What about the US navy in 2011? In 2011, the US controlled roughly 50% of the world’s naval power putting it in a comfortable lead in naval power ahead of Russia (11%).The US Navy has decreased in absolute size as Governor Romney argues (although this decline has been ongoing since the end of Cold War). U.S. warships are more powerful now than in the past, as President Obama implied. However, neither the number of warships nor the power of our ships is what is most important for understanding military and political influence. It is relative military power that matters most. In this respect, the U.S. navy is far stronger now than in 1916.http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/23/how-strong-is-the-u-s-navy-really/So unless folks think differently, I'll mark this a Half true, as it seems true only in the technical sense of the number of ships."
314,"From ezra klien: Note that Romney calls for post-bankruptcy guarantees, not pre-bankruptcy guarantees. That’s the rub: The credit markets were frozen, and most experts thought Detroit couldn’t find the private financing to survive a masnaged bankruptcy.People seem to be hung up on the fact that Romney wanted the US to guarantee the loans.According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_guarantee, this means the US assumes control of the debt should the borrower default on the loan.  However it says nothing of whether they can provide the loan in the first place, and since Romney wanted auto companies to find financing through the private market instead, it makes Obama's point fairly validFrom this article, it quotes Romney from a republican debate:--But later, as he began seeking the Republican presidential nomination, he became more critical of it—referring to it repeatedly as a “bailout” and criticizing the use of taxpayer dollars. One of the clearest statements on this specific issue came in late 2011, during a CNBC debate of Republican presidential contenders:    ""My view with regards to the bailout was that whether it was by President Bush or by President Obama, it was the wrong way to go. I said from the very beginning they should go through a managed bankruptcy process, a private bankruptcy process. We have capital markets and bankruptcy... My plan, we would have had a private sector bailout with the private sector restructuring and bankruptcy with the private sector guiding the direction as opposed to what we had with government playing its heavy hand.""http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/109008/romney-obama-debate-auto-detroit-bailout-gm-chrysler-taxpayer-government-loansThere hasn't been any debate on this one in over a month, and all evidence seems to point to this one being **True**. The sort of assistance GM would have needed to stay afloat was assistance Romney was opposed to. And what assistance Romney *did* approve of would not have helped."
315,"[Here](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/di_asr/index.html) you can find an annual statistics report from the Social Security Administration. If you look at their [tables](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/di_asr/2011/di_asr11.xlsx), you'll see a few interesting things. Firstly, the very first table shows that with a brief exception in the early 80s, disability claims have *always* gone up. This is very likely due to *population growth*.Table 2 shows that the largest group receiving benefits is people between 60 and 65, and disability claims are lumped around them. Why would that be? Well, and this is just speculation, but it seems to me that the older someone gets, the more likely they are to have health problems... and as it happens, the Baby Boomers (one of the biggest surges of population growth in recent history) are aging. [This](http://www.incontextmag.com/article/Keeping-deep-knowledge-from-being-lost) online business magazine includes [this](http://www.incontextmag.com/images/KnowledgeTransfer-Retirement_graph.jpg) handy graphic showing just how many people are expected to reach the age of 62 in a given year. Notice how it goes up in 2009? Again, this number is tied to the population, and that population has a lot of people getting *old* right around the time Obama took office. And these old people are the largest group claiming disability. It also bears mention that 62 is *also* the age that people qualify for Social Security, which makes it a fine retirement age.So the increase in disability claims and the decrease in ""worker participation"" statistically would seem to be caused by the growing number of people hitting that 60-65 age group, who are often likely to either either retire or file for disability.The increase of disability claims comes from the Baby Boomer generation finally hitting retirement in large numbers.Krugman computes demographic-adjusted unemployment number [in this blog post](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/constant-demography-employment-wonkish-but-relevant/). This shows that the ""removal from unemployment rolls"" effect the OP mentions is real, but on the whole rather small. However, the effect does arises from a simple demographics shift, not from policy, let alone from any ""drastic move to place people on disability"". So the OP's claim is **false**.> Now that they have a monthly government check, *they are never, ever going back to work*, and they are no longer treated by the government as unemployed, since they are not seeking work.Emphasis mine. With unbiased sources like that how could this be wrong? ;)"
316,"From the Truthout article above:> Through a closely held equity fund called Solamere, Mitt Romney and his wife, son and brother are major investors in an investment firm called H.I.G. Capital.

Unlike other private equity firms, Solamere does not invest in companies directly. Instead, Solamere invests in other private equity funds, like H.I.G. Capital.So the chain is:* Mitt Romney* Solamere* H.I.G Capital* Hart Intercivic (voting machine manufacturer)In that order.  Solamere was indeed founded by Romney's son and some Romney friends.  H.I.G Capital also has a number of former Bain executives working there.  But really all that can be proved here is that Tagg Romney invests in a company that invests in a company that builds voting machines, which, to me, is more degrees of separation than OP's title implies.As an aside, Hart Intercivic appears to have a some sort of security analysis thingie [here](http://www.hartintercivic.com/files/HART_SYMANTEC_SECURITY__REPORT_White_Paper.pdf), if anyone wants to see that.  God help us if those machines run Norton Anti-Virus, though.Let's just take them at their word:>Through a closely held equity fund called Solamere, Mitt Romney and his wife, son and brother are major investors in an investment firm called H.I.G.

A private citizen cannot purchase a voting machine.  I suppose, technically, you could if the company would sell to you, but I see no indication of this ever having happened, ever.So, no, **this is false on its face.**  None of the Romneys *own* voting machines or even the company that makes them.  They are, as others have clarified, invested in a company which invested in a company which sells voting machines (or whatever).  It is a business interest which is at least two degrees removed.

318,"[Here is the DOE link that lists all of the companies that received loans of the type Solyndra received (and then some).](https://lpo.energy.gov/?page_id=45)A couple of points on it:* Many of those companies are not strictly solar companies.  Ford, Nissan, Exelon and Prologis are four examples.*  Of the '33 loans that received loan gaurantees', 7 are dissimilar loans from Solyndra.  *  Of the '33 loans that received loan guarantees', only 9 are currently generating electricity.* The referenced /r/politics thread cherrypicks over Beacon Power and Abound Solar because they had repaid their loans.Now onto the referenced [WSJ article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204331304577140850713493694.html) mentioned in the thread:> Among the findings: 22% either filed for bankruptcy reorganization or closed their doors by the end of the eighth year after Bain first invested, sometimes with substantial job losses. An additional 8% ran into so much trouble that all of the money Bain invested was lost.* So we're comparing a loan program that's three years old to an eight year track record with Bain?  * In fact, the same article states that if it went down to 5 years after Bain took over, the percentage goes down to 12%.* Many of those companies were no longer under Bain's influence when they filed for bankruptcy.Out of the gate, I think this is an apples to oranges comparison.  I'd say this warrants a half true or, preferably, a mostly false designation.For the first part; Report from Wall Street Journal dated Jan-9-2012 - [Romney at Bain: Big Gains, Some Busts ](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204331304577140850713493694.html)> ""Among the findings: **22% either filed for bankruptcy reorganization or closed their doors** by the end of the eighth year after Bain first invested, sometimes with substantial job losses. An additional **8% ran into so much trouble that all of the money Bain invested was lost**.""For the second part; from the Washington Post dated Oct-4-2012 - [A closer look at Obama’s “$90 billion for green jobs”](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/04/a-closer-look-at-obamas-90-billion-for-clean-energy/)> ""Romney’s campaign later clarified that he was solely referring to the Energy Department’s 1705 loan program, which provides about $16.1 billion to clean-energy companies. Yet of the 33 companies that have received loan guarantees, just three are in bankruptcy—including Solyndra, which could cost the government up to $535 million. (The other two firms are Abound Solar and Beacon Power, which is still operating and has largely repaid its federal loan.) Additional companies could eventually fail, but for now, the default rate is just **2.6 percent** for one program in the stimulus.""Provided these reports are accurate, this appears to be true.It's the gross, not the ratio that matters, anyway. If you play high stakes where the odds and the payout are where you want them to be, losing often can be acceptable within the plan, so long as the expectation of a high payout on success is met, and covers them.Bain Capital invests in firms which aren't doing terribly well in the first place. That's their business model. They don't buy Apple and make a whole bunch of top-down changes.On the other hand, companies which are recipients of heavy government subsidy don't fail very often? Whodathunk! If I was basically doing okay to begin with and someone came along with a pile of money I bet I could manage not to go bankrupt, too.Even if the numbers turn out to be broadly accurate, I'm not sure what they prove.So is the consensus that the numbers are accurate, but not precisely a fair comparison as the length of time for each investment's failure rate was so different?"
319,"Apparently, this is from a statement made by Rep. John Mica (R-FL)>“It costs passengers $9.50 to buy a cheeseburger on Amtrak, but the cost to taxpayers is $16.15,” said Mica. “Riders pay $2.00 for a Pepsi, but each of these sodas costs the U.S. Treasury $3.40.”I don't know where he pulled those numbers from, though.edit: Still trying to find the report those numbers came from, but here is a quote from the head of the rail authority who I wouldn't think would be lying about his own shitty numbers (from [here](http://blogs.ajc.com/jamie-dupree-washington-insider/2012/08/02/amtrak-takes-flak-over-food-service-losses/)):>The same argument was made by the head of the rail authority that runs Amtrak trains between Boston and Portland, Maine - their food and beverage revnue per passenger was $1.09 last year, but the expenses of providing that service $1.47.Soda is [incredibly high margin](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/09/08/top-5-food-mark-ups-where-restaurants-make-huge-profits/), so the fact that Amtrack would be taking a loss on their would represent a massive, unholy failure. I can believe that on shorter routes, most passengers would simply choose not to pay $2 for a can of soda, such that Amtrack doesn't recoup the cost of offering food on that particular journey, but it seems somewhat unlikely to me that on a can for can basis they are losing money.[deleted]Amtrak loses money because there are not enough passengers on board to cover all their expenses.  The price of a pop/soda has nothing to do with it.  If a company is losing money, they are not losing money on everything they do.  You can do subtotals for lots of expenses and revenues and some things will make money and some things will lose money. In the case of Amtrak, those things that lose money ... lose more money than those things that make money.Since there seems to be some new subscribers in here.

However, the physical location of Gitmo is not what was controversial; the system of indefinite detention, being thrown in prison without trial is what was wrong, and Obama made it clear in a speech near the beginning of his presidency he was embracing ""prolonged detention"", so at least congress kept a lawless jail off our shores.

This claim refers to [Page 33, sec. 2713](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33), which says that health insurance must include preventive care for women supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. And the Health Resources and Services Administration, on the recommendation of the independent Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, has determined that preventive care for women should include access to well women visits, domestic violence screening, and, yes, contraception.So insurers *do* have to provide these services, and they *cannot* require their insured to pay for them. This is because birth control, particularly its effects on hormones and stuff, are very important to the health of some women.""But what if I, as a taxpayer, don't want to pay for it?"" You don't. It's provided by the health insurance company, not the government. ""But what about employers who provide employee plans? Does that mean a church would have to pay for the birth control of its clergy?"" you ask?The answer is ""no"". On February 10, 2012 (or February 15th, if you go by the header in the document), the Department of Health and Human Services issued [this document](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-02-15/pdf/2012-3547.pdf), detailing its enforcement of that section of the ACA. [Kaiser](http://policyinsights.kff.org/2012/february/insurance-coverage-of-contraceptives.aspx) has given their own interpretation of this. The short version is, churches and houses of worship are exempt from this rule, period. Other religious employers (like Catholic hospitals) are also exempt until August 2013, by which time insurance providers are to have created special plans specifically for them, that put all the costs of contraception on the insurer, with none on the employee *or* the employer. So not one cent of taxpayer money is going towards contraception, nor is a single cent of a church's money paying for contraception either. Birth control is to be provided to women *by the insurer*.Did CaspainX2 get it right and this is the main fact to be vetted? ""Despite two pathetic feints at 'compromise,' Obama’s illegal requirement that faith-based groups pay for policies providing immoral 'reproductive services' remains in full force.""I've tagged this as Partisan Bias.

325,"I did some digging and this was covered in a [FactCheck.org article](http://factcheck.org/2012/10/romneys-4000-tax-tale/)Before I continue. It seems other Fact Checking resources have been a bit of an issue lately. Just because FactCheck.org or Politifact, or any other resource draws a conclusion, does not mean it is shared here. Their analysis of the evidence is what they are useful for, as they almost always have a reference to the source material that is used in claims. Linking to their articles makes it easier for all of us to find the source of the claim and scrutinize it ourselves. The analysis says >The ads cite a conservative group’s study, but even the group itself doesn’t say Obama will raise taxes on middle-income taxpayers. It says his budget could result in a “potentially higher tax burden” over the next 10 years.>In fact, the group’s study considered two other budget scenarios — current law (allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of this year) and current policy (extending current policies into 2013, including extending the Bush-era tax cuts) — and determined that Obama’s budget “provides a middle ground between these two extremes.”>The American Enterprise Institute, which conducted the study, is described in one of Romney’s ads as “nonpartisan” and “independent.” In fact, it is a conservative, pro-business think tank whose leaders include former Vice President Dick Cheney and whose academic advisers include Romney’s chief economic adviser, R. Glenn Hubbard. Three of its board members — including its chairman — gave nearly $1.7 million in combined contributions to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.>Regardless of the group’s political leanings and Romney’s misuse of its study, AEI makes a valid point. Debt being accumulated today is going to cost future taxpayers plenty, especially when today’s unusually low interest rates begin to rise. And debt will still be rising for years, whoever is elected.[An AEI post which references the study. Title of the post is - **Study: Obama’s big budget deficits could mean a $4,000 a year middle-class tax hike**](http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/10/study-obamas-big-budget-deficits-could-mean-a-4000-a-year-middle-class-tax-hike/)[Direct link to the PDF of the study Title of the study is - **A Simple Measure of the Distributional Burden of Debt Accumulation**](http://www.aei.org/files/2012/10/01/-a-simple-measure-of-the-distributional-burden-of-debt-accumulation_210316287852.pdf)The study itself seems to base it's conclusions partially off the Administratiosn FY2013 Budget ProposalFrom the PDF:>Accurately projecting the budget is particularly difficult right now because large portions of the tax code and government spending  are  scheduled to change in January 2013.  Following Auerbach and Gale (2010), we examine the cost of  the total accumulated debt of the United States, the debt burden accumulated over recent presidencies, and projections of debt accrual over the next ten years under current law, current policy, and the Administration’s 2013 budget.I think the most relevant point to this claim is that the FY2013 Budget Proposal failed to be passed by Congress.[On the motion to proceed to a vote in the Senate. It had 0 AYE votes and 99 NAY Votes](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/sconres41)I've seen many people here quote the FactCheck.org article, but I think Romney's campaign may have worded their point incorrectly. The $4,000 tax increase has been thrown around on a lot of conservative networks, but it is not tied to spending proposals. There is a growing worry that the President will not extend the [Bush Tax Cuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts) once they expire at the end of the year. I know Charles Krauthammer discussed this yesterday. If the Bush Tax Cuts expire, middle class families can expect to see a jump in taxes, *as much as* $4,000 per year. I'd say that's probably the high end of the number. Feel free to disagree, but perhaps this is what those emails were referring to?[FactCheck.org looked at this one](http://factcheck.org/2012/10/romneys-4000-tax-tale/). It looks like they're basing this number on a study that projects the costs associated with debt for two plans, and assumes that Obama's plan will be somewhere between the two.So it's already being hazy with its estimates, and it's assuming that the burdens of debt will translate into taxes for the middle-class, which we cannot know for sure, but given Obama's prior assertions about wanting to raise taxes on the ""Top 2%"" and not the middle class, this seems unlikely.FactCheck's verdict is:> It’s wrong to say Obama — or Romney, for that matter — has a “plan” to raise taxes by a given amount on any particular group.I would rate this ""Mostly false"" or ""false"".Edit: Disregard. FactCheck explains what Ryan is referencing. See other posts.I'm thinking this may be unverifiable at the moment. They're saying taxes will go up in the future, and don't specify how. It seems like speculation. It's hard enough to get reliable figures on what taxes people have paid in the last couple years, let alone in the next few years.I did some Googling, but future tax rates are mythical, like the unicorn. If we knew on what basis they're making the claim, it might help. I'm assuming there's no elaboration in that e-mail?"

329,"I don't have the data in front of me, but there's a logical error in the article here. > Of the administration's 20 top earners, who each took home a tidy $172,200 for their work in 2011, only six of those were women.... and then ...> The hefty salaries, like Ms Jarrett's, were not the norm, however, as the median salary for women in the White House is $60,000 which is 18 per cent less than their male peers whose median salary was $71,000.If the people in the highest (and highest paid) positions are men, assuming no other effects, the median salary for men is going to be higher than the one for women. It doesn't violate the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"". It simply states that the men have higher ranking positions (a topic for another discussion).I don't have time at the moment to sift through the employment data at the moment, but the real question is whether or not two people doing the same job with the same title earn the same amount, controlling for hiring date, performance, etc.I'm going to wager that this'll end up ""unverifiable"" because the sample size is too small for accurate statistics, but I'm hoping someone might be able to prove me wrong.[2011 White House annual staff report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/annual-records/2011).  Median salary for women: $60,000.  Median salary for men: $71,000  Relative to position, however, pay is equal.  This does leave us with the conclusion that in the Obama Administration men are given higher paying/more important jobs than women.  edit: formattinghttp://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/annual-records/2011There are men who are getting paid a lot more than women in there and it looks like there are a lot more men than women. However, if you order by position, as I did, it looks like women and men are paid equally based on their job titles. Occasionally there is a man and woman who have the same job title, but the man gets paid more. Conversely, sometimes there is a woman and man who have the same job title in which the woman gets paid more. I don't think this can be said to be true or false without knowing the backgrounds and experiences of those who are working in the White House.Regardless, in this country as a whole, women are getting paid a substantial amount less than men.It's also worth noting that the pay gap exists in the Senate too:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.)—47.6 percent less pay for women  Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.)—40 percent  Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.)—34.2 percent  Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.)—31.5 percent  Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.)—30.4 percent  Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.)–29.7 percent  Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.)–29.2 percent  Sen. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.)—26.5 percent  Sen.

Throughout his speech, all of Obama's references to the attacks in Benghazi were referred to as just that, ""attacks"" and were never referred to directly as ""acts of terror"", ""terrorist attacks"" or any variation thereof.It should also be noted that Mrs. Crowley's statement that it took two weeks for the idea that the attacks were caused by an offensive video to get out were clearly wrong. In Obama's Rose Garden speech he explicitly addresses America's ""rejection of all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others"", and states that this is, however, no excuse for these attacks. Clearly the implication is that the attacks are thought to be the result of ""denigrating the religious beliefs of others"". In addition, you can clearly see this similar line of thinking posed by the media before and in the days following the Rose Garden speech.You have access to the same source material via the URLs above.

I know it's semantics, but Obama didn't actually call it a terrorist act or that attack specifically an act of terror.

Back of the envelope math time!If I'm reading [this](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm) right, one percent is ~2.4M people (155M/63.6%).

334,">Mitt believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, **he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade** – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate-http://www.mittromney.com/issues/values(emphasis added)Do these politicians forget that Roe v. Wade has already been superseded by Planned Parenthood v. Casey?Mitt Romney has said he wants *The Supreme Court* to [overturn Roe v. Wade](http://www.lifenews.com/2012/10/15/romney-i-want-the-supreme-court-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/).  Obviously he can't do it by decree.  What he could do is replace a liberal justice with a conservative, and Roe v. Wade will be reversed.  There is no doubt that Scalia/Thomas/Alito would do it in a second.  Add another justice of their ilk and Roe goes down.The statement is blatantly false despite being tagged as true.The president has no power to overturn Judicial law.  There is nothing anyone has provided that states anything different.  He believes that overturning Roe vs Wade is the next step, but nothing that he would execute dictatorial power over it.Are we fact checking or are we pushing political agendas?"
335,"I keep changing my mind on the rating, so I'll give the [raw transcript](http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1202/22/se.05.html).> KING: -- he told me this week here in Mesa -- these are his words -- ""it's called political garbage, if you will, to not arrest illegals already in this country.""> You've talked to the governor about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. What about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as the Sheriff Arpaio advocates?> ROMNEY: You know, I think you see a model in Arizona. They passed a law here that says -- that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on e- verify. This e-verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. > And as a result of e-verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent. So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing.> (APPLAUSE) > And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough border patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E- Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. > You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal ? immigration. It's time we finally did it.So, yes, Mitt Romney did use the words ""model for the nation"" while answering a question about the law in general but, if you read the whole quote, he heavily focused on eVerify and never specifically mentioned the ""papers, please"" aspect.He does, however, endorse the law in general when he says that he'll drop the lawsuits from the federal government over constitutional and civil rights issues.I can argue this anywhere from mostly false (e-Verify was the ""model for the nation"") to mostly true (He said the law was a model for the nation. That he mentioned eVerify first doesn't mean that's the only part that was a model for the nation, especially if he thinks the gov't should drop the lawsuits).Hmmmm. Thought this might illustrate something but now I'm not sure it does either. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Wj6CGEmuA&feature=youtube_gdata_playerSeems like the consensus here is for ""half-true"" - so let me know if folks disagree with that, but marking this as such now...."
336,"From (pro-Republican) RedState.com:>The volume of oil imports in 2011 were at the same level as 2000. Expressed **as a percentage of total consumption, however, the 2011 share of imports was back down to 1995 levels.** [Link](http://www.redstate.com/2012/10/17/paging-mr-oil-mr-gas-mr-coal-obama-on-energy/)[Here's RedState's source.](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=727&t=6)So did the President's phrasing denote an absolute number or is it open to being a proportion of total consumption? This seems subjective and I won't try to answer it.From OntheIssues.org (2012):>In his State of the Union speech, Obama said, ""Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in 8 years. Last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.""All that is true--as far as it goes. The current 2011 average for US petroleum production is 7,782 million barrels per day, the highest since 1998. And the current average for US dependence on foreign oil is 45.4%. That's the lowest since 1995.>But economists say the chief reason for the declining oil imports is reduced consumption, brought on by the recent economic recession. And--what the president also didn't mention--the annual average price of a gallon of gasoline was $3.52 in 2011--the highest in history. It's small comfort to motorists that prices spiked even higher for a brief period under George W. Bush. http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Barack_Obama_Energy_+_Oil.htmSo there's this additional caveat in that last paragraph that might be of interest to the mods when assigning flair.Interesting note about context:I'm going to complicate things further by pointing out that both candidates have been speaking as if imports from Canada *are not imports*. Things like ""getting all our oil right here in North America"" and increasing imports from Canada have been used as if they mean cutting imports even though strictly speaking they don't. The obvious reason for this (false) dichotomy is that Americans have become averse to ME oil due to the Iraq war, among other things. In this sense, it is meaningful that Americans don't think of Canadian oil in the same negative light as ME oil, so it's not a *deceptively* false dichotomy, necessarily. I haven't checked the context in which Obama said this, but I know Romney in that debate at some point equated foreign oil with foreign oil from overseas (to the exclusion of the Canadian product). Under this erroneous definition, the statement would be correct -- not that I think we should use that definition, it's just useful to keep in mind IMO.I believe this was discussed in the Official PoliticalFactChecking thread.http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/11kvuw/official_politicalfactchecking_thread_for_the_9pm/c6nkchjhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/securing-american-energyIncreasing American Energy IndependenceSince President Obama took office, America’s dependence on foreign oil has decreased every year. In 2010, the United States imported less than half of all oil consumed – a first in 13 years. In fact, net imports as a share of total consumption declined from 57 percent in 2008 to 45 percent in 2011 – the lowest level in 16 years. In the last year alone, we have cut net oil imports by 10 percent – a million barrels per day."
337,"Key to this version of the story is that the ""binder"" was created prior to Romney's election:""What actually happened was that in 2002 -- prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration -- a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGAP to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government. There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.""  http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspxOne story here: ""I will write more about this later, but for tonight let me just make a few quick additional points. First of all, according to MassGAP and MWPC, Romney did appoint 14 women out of his first 33 senior-level appointments, which is a reasonably impressive 42 percent. However, as I have reported before, those were almost all to head departments and agencies that he didn't care about -- and in some cases, that he quite specifically wanted to not really do anything. None of the senior positions Romney cared about -- budget, business development, etc. -- went to women. Secondly, a UMass-Boston study found that the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006. (It then began rapidly rising when Deval Patrick took office.)...""  http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx"
338,"It partisan bias because it's an extremely cherry picked number, as the recession hit and use dropped, the price nose-dived. Average prices leading up to the election were far higher, including highs that we have not reached during the past 4 years.http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspxSelect the 8 year and it's easy to see gas prices were higher and that starting in September started falling dramatically. So while the absolute fact is true, the implication is not and thus partisan bias since the claim leaves out all context.Gas prices often fall during recessions. Not the article I read but one that supports this. http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/05/20/do-falling-gas-prices-spell-recession/Crashing economy.  With less people driving that means less demand for oil.  Falling demand and rising supply means a drop in prices.[This academic paper](http://dss.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/Hamilton_oil_shock_08.pdf) sums up the reasons behind the increase in gas prices between 2007-08 - simply put, it was a combination of increased worldwide demand and a plateau in oil production between 2005-2007 (the effect from monetary policy and speculators, the other cited culprits of rising gas prices, was not as significant). As for the sharp drop in prices, declining economic activity was a major influence. The paper also identifies shifts in demand elasticity - a measure of how responsive people's purchasing decisions are to the price of a good - and their role in amplifying the movement in prices.To the best of my ability (I'm not the best statistician) there are no significant errors measured in the paper, so I do think that sums up the whole fluctuation in gas prices. I didn't watch the debate so I don't know the context of Romney's statement; if he was merely stating that gas was at one point $1.86 in 2008 then True, if he was implying that gas prices were sub $2.00 from 2008 and prior, then Half-True.Oil is a global commodity, so when worldwide supplies were unable to increase fast enough, the result was prices taking a very noticeable march upwards from 2007 on in order to reduce demand.  Several large markets for petroleum products being heavily subsidized (most notably China and India), their domestic demand growth was insulated from the impact of tightening world supplies, further causing the global market prices to spike.Other possible contributing factors include the constriction of opportunities for profitable investments to be made in retail/manufacturing/service sectors as the economy slowed, thus moving investment capital into the bubbles of commodities markets; also the debt bubble fueled inflation - including that of commodities - and at about this time Iran stopped accepting US dollars for oil altogether, which didn't help the ability of US dollars to buy barrels of oil.(There are also plenty of accusations regarding the role of speculation in the oil markets and of suppliers artificially restricting product from reaching market in order to profit more greatly when it was finally delivered).In any case, the bubble finally burst as the global economy ground to a halt, taking with it some of the demand for oil products and supplied oil lost 3/4 of its value compared to its price only a few months before.  Obama's inauguration was within a few weeks of oil hitting its lowest point.http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2009/01/average-gas-pricesjanuary-26-2009.htmlThis has the week Obama was elected, and they've got it pegged at $1.84.The summer of '08 was before the crash"

Tone is difficult to convey on the internet and I don't want to sound like a dick. I appreciate all the work you've done for this community. That said...1. Don't post ""15 minutes to debate"" or ""25 viewers here"". It adds clutter to the comments. Maybe you could start an IRC room where we can have a discussion and you could post updates about meta-information about the community?

It's great that people are watching the debate and posting requests, but if we get five requests for ""Is X true?"" and then five responses to each request, the discussion can get confusing quickly.3. Actively moderate and remove uncited claims. We should be heavily relying on sources in this subreddit. Having a discussion on separate posts seems to be working out as other posts only have about 20 comments. However, during the debates, we can have hundreds of comments of people furiously posting and questioning others' posts.

343,"> any suggestions, advice, ideas for how we can do this better?If I may offer my two cents, I think mods need to be more aggressive in removing things that do not concur with the guidelines in the sidebar.  As this site becomes more popular, it will draw more people interested in circlejerking and pushing an agenda.  Recently, [I saw this fact check thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/11eczs/its_being_reported_that_biden_cut_off_ryan_82/).  One of the more obvious trolls was removed, but there are several other users posting things in that thread that don't concur with the guidelines, and don't live up to the spirit of this unique and cool subreddit.  Many people complain when mods are overactive, and sometimes mods do overreach, but active mods can really keep a community focused and on point . . . just look at /r/askscience.My two cents, fwiw.And btw, third debate topics announced:http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/10/13/third-debate-topics-announced.htmlForeign policy debate :PI can only guess the number of times Benghazi/House hearing are going to be brought up for topic #1.The China topic should also be very interesting, but I fear it will revolve mainly around campaign ads and won't be detail-specific...but who knows."
344,"Also, do we have the number of times Romney cut off Obama or the moderator?i find 82 hard to believe.They must be counting every syllable he uttered in trying to get a word in.There weren't even 82 answers to interrupt.[Here is a video claiming to show the number of interruptions as 85](http://vimeo.com/51308728#).  I think it's pretty aggressive on what counts as an interruption, but VP Biden did clearly interrupt Congressman Ryan couple dozen times.I agree with the 'unverifiable' claim, as there is no way you could show solid agreement on what constitutes an interruption.This is more of a research question than a fact check, so marking it unverifiable.http://www.theblaze.com/stories/unprecedented-watch-joe-biden-interrupt-paul-ryan-85-times-during-debate/The website seems right leaning but the video doesn't seem to have duplicate scenes. If you follow r/conservative, there was a post that said he was interrupted 113 times, which might be stretching it a bit, but also had a valid point that the moderator was showing bias in debate. Also, I personally watched the debate last night and thought both of the candidates were full of it, but because Biden was almost childish in his performance and discipline, he opened himself up to verbal follies.[removed][removed]"
345,"Romney is mistaken or lying.  Quite a few people die because they lack insurance that would enable them to receive treatment for chronic conditions that ultimately cause preventable death.http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/I've been a paramedic in Dallas (mainly in the poor southern half) for almost ten years and I've seen at least a hundred people die for lack of healthcare.  Especially old guys with chest pain.  They don't want to run their families into bankruptcy and they've just got to play tough guy and they sit there suffering for hours and hours until their wife or one of their kids finally calls 911 against their wishes and by then the damage has been done.  Same thing with strokes, wounds, falls, MVC's, COPD, CHF exacerbations, you-name-it.People are constantly failing to make good healthcare decisions for themselves because they're afraid of the crushing debt and who can blame them?tl;dr, Mitt Romney is full of shit.I'm not dying, but my life would be immeasurably better if I were able to afford a surgery that I need done.[deleted]This statement is so broad and sweeping, it's nearly impossible for it to _not_ be false.  One might say it's 'trivially false' in the sense that the inverse claim--that every year at least a few people die without receiving care because they don't have insurance--is trivially true.However, since people without health care are documented to receive a fraction of the preventative care that nearly all doctors agree is the most important factor in health and longevity, I would argue that it is substantially and incontestably false as well, even if it is difficult to isolate the variables enough to indicate exactly how many of the 45,000,000 actually die as a direct result of lack of access to care.This is the sad state of political discourse that is America today. That anyone would have to come to a sub-reddit to verify such an obvious lie is a lie. Fuck. Sometimes I really think we're doomed.The larger point he's making is that the decision to have healthcare is a **choice** (as evidence by the title of the article).The vast vast majority of the people without healthcare aren't dying from it.  50 million people without healthcare, 45 thousand deaths per year from lack of health insurance (see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/11da5c/romney_claimed_we_dont_have_people_that_become/c6lg8hc) comment).The ""just go to the ER for treatment"" idea is so disingenuous.  ER's are only required to treat people who are in critically injured or ill.  And even at that, they are only required to stabilize the patient, after which the patient can be transferred to another health care facility for treatment, or out on the street.  Free care comes only if the patient has no assets of any kind.  They will take everything they can from the patient, and write the rest off.  Patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, Crohn's disease, or any other number of illnesses do not receive treatment through the ER...until they become critically ill.OK more then well documented here that this is false. It may be hyperbole, trying to make a larger point. But the words chosen express a patently false idea that you have documented as such. Adding flair now."
346,"Amber lyon talks extensively about this issue on the joe rogan experience podcast (episode from a week or two ago titled ""amber lyon"". She explains about how the govermemt in Bahrain sponsers cnn international but also basically pays cnn international to not cover anything that would make them look bad so cnn has ignored all of the attrocities they are commiting including gassing certain villages DAILY.. since the bahrain government is relies on the US govt. to be propped up and funded then we are indirectly paying cnn to not run stories that would reveal the truth about the type of horrible regime we support there.You should probably provide at least one link/source to blogs making this assertion. Some quick googling I stumbled on this:http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/10/09/cnn-exposed-emmy-winning-former-cnn-journalist-amber-lyon-blows-the-whistle-simultaneously-answers-one-of-my-questions/YT is blocked at the office, but I'll look up what I can.*Yeah I went to the 1min30 mark as the blog instructed, but I found nothing relevant or at least immediately obvious to confirm what that entire blog post is suggesting.I'm extremely hesitant to even entertain this. But I get so intellectually insulted by people grasping at things that might not be there.Their point that is used to support their argument>What Amber Lyon describes is exactly the reason why CNN never aired the Nick Robertson interview with Muhammed Al Zawahiri in Egypt.Whether or not they aired it on television I can't be sure, but the video is most definitely on their website. http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/world/meast/zawahiri-peace-plan/index.htmlThat is the Mohamed al-Zawahiri interview with Nick Robertson that they claimed CNN didn't air. Next the site says>Having just returned from Bahrain, Lyon says she “saw first-hand that these regime claims were lies, and I couldn’t believe CNN was making me put what I knew to be government lies into my reporting.”>Here is a segment of the Bahrain report that Amber Lyon and her team put together.  CNNi refused to allow it to air because the Bahrain Government had paid them not to show it.CNN has a page just for this http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/16/cnn%E2%80%99s-amber-lyon-reports-on-the-digital-roots-of-the-%E2%80%98arab-spring%E2%80%99/Reported as being aired on CNN on June 19th, 2011TV Guide Listings for this show?[Scanned copy of print TV Listing showing CNN Presents for June 19th 2011](http://www.scribd.com/doc/58039692/TV-Weekly-June-19-2011)[CNN's transcript of their CNN Presents for June 19th 2011: iRevolution documentary by Amber Lyon](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1106/19/cp.01.html)[TvTango listing for June 19th 2011 showing CNN Presents: iRevolution](http://www.tvtango.com/listings/2011/06/19) TvTango is an TV Guide aggregate that lists you search listings by dateOk. So we are positive this aired atleast on CNN's United States broadcast. If the issue is that CNN International didn't air it, I have to point out it seems to be a moot point.In the age of information, these productions can be viewed instantly. Social networks like Facebook, Skype, and Twitter were used during the Arab revolution. Protests spread all throughout the middle east based off a youtube video. To think that not showing this on CNNi was vast censorship ignores the reality that this documentary can be viewed online within 20 seconds of using Google. http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=irevolution&oq=irevolution&gs_l=youtube.3..0l6.892.2216.0.2351.11.7.0.4.4.0.24.120.7.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.npo_HFj1kZ0It is as simple as reading CNN's promotion for it, and then googling it. The sections which were ""censored"" were broadcast on CNN US and have been on youtube since June 2011. For a moment let's assume that this was intentional censorship. How incredibly incredibly inept CNN's executives must be. They were so inept, that their censored documentary had its entire transcript uploaded online and is still there. Available for anyone to read. Lyon worked for CNN, and was not a freelancer at the time so CNN owns the rights to that segment. They were so inept and so interested in censorship that they allowed their segment to be viewed at the New York Festivals International Television & Film Awards 2012.And when it won a Gold Medal, they [posted it to their awards page](http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/cnn-awards/)They are so inept, that they allowed it to air in the United States where it had the absolute best chance to bring public awareness to Bahrain and have the best chance of bringing public pressure on Obama. There are also credibility issues. Now from what I have read Amber Lyon is a good journalist. I'm not trying to discredit her, but to look at her motives as well as CNN's motives. I have to question a reporter who claims censorship and conspiracy, only after she was fired. I have to question the integrity of a reporter who claims that they willfully reported fake stories, and deleted stories for political reasons (at the behest of their network) but then only seeks out publicity about it after they are fired. Now I have no doubt that Amber Lyon believes she was censored. She seems like a sincere person, the issue is that so many other sites are jumping in support of what she is claiming without examining all of the details. Which brings this down to it's political relevance in here. If the Obama administration is paying CNN to withhold and fabricate stories. This is simply an unverifiable claim. There is no evidence of this other than Lyon's word, and her supporter's speculation. Frankly. The idea of censorship in the age of global information can be a news station showing a documentary on one channel, but not another is ludicrous. If this was truly censorship, we would barely be able to find traces of this documentary online. It is simply unverifiable speculation.All the sources I'm finding for this are pretty dubious:[Source One is NSFW, oddly.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/3-time-emmy-award-winning-cnn-journalist-mainstream-media-takes-money-from-foreign-dictators-to-run-flattering-propaganda.html)[Source Two](http://beforeitsnews.com/blogging-citizen-journalism/2012/10/cnn-exposed-emmy-winning-former-cnn-journalist-amber-lyon-blows-the-whistle-2444190.html)[Source Three](http://enenews.com/horrific-cnn-journalist-reveals)There's a conspiracy theory laden video from infowars on one or others of them.  Amber Lyon is admittedly a former CNN employee.  I personally don't believe it, but maybe the best thing to do is mark it as unverifiable or developing, or something.Agreed with folks here, this is malarkey."
347,"Just want to point out that the claim is not from the Washington Post, but from one of the co-authors of the TPC study, Adam Looney.I think your example reflects Dubay's proposal pretty well; the revenue lost from eliminating the estate tax would be made up for somewhat by applying the capital gains tax on the sale/purchase price instead of the sale/inheritance price. The argument that Looney makes though is that the $19 billion number reflects the revenue the government would raise if the loophole was closed on ALL inherited assets, gifts and other generational taxes - and Dubay's proposal only applies to property/estate. That would mean the revenue from Dubay's proposal would probably be less that $19 billion - I couldn't tell you by how much though (and Looney doesn't provide a number either), because generational taxes generally tend to get lumped together into a single line in budget tables."
348,"So it seems VP Biden lumped together a good amount of legislation together in his talking point. **""voting to put two wars on a credit card""**- Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists- Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002Without clarifying statements, it is kind of hard to ascertain if Joe Biden was also talking about legislation that extended the timeline of the war and maintained the costs. So for now, I think we should view his votes on authorizing the war. **""at the same time, put a prescription drug plan on the credit card""**- Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Medicare Modernization Act included Medicare Part D which was the Prescription Drug program started under George W. Bush **""a trillion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy""**- Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001- Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003Those seem to be the baseline legislation that cover the wars, prescription drug plan, and tax cuts. .As for the votes.

I think he DID vote against both of those, can anyone confirm his vote on those two?The way this is worded makes it seem that he was *probably* referring only to the last two or three items in the list, but the grammar is fuzzy in this case.  If he had intended his ""I voted against them"" statement to be inclusive to the whole list he probably would have said ""I voted against every one of these things"" or something like that.Obviously this is not a ""fact check,"" but the fuzzy grammar and off-the-cuff nature of the quote means we should give it the benefit of the doubt and wait for some follow-up questions to clarify before we make a decision either way.He voted against the first gulf war, but voted for both Afghanistan and the Iraq war.

I searched through their publications but I don't believe that his analysis was publicized by them.[Here is a copy of an article he wrote explaining the $2 trillion difference between Romney's 4% Plan and the projected Defense Spending under Obama's plan from 2013-2022](http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/10/08/budget_crunched_the_facts_of_romney_s_proposed_2_trillion_defense_increase)[removed]Agreed with everyone here: evidence is there than this is confirmed.If anyone is interested, here's what Romney said on Oct 8 at the VA Military institute:Transcipt: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/politics/mitt-romney-remarks-at-virginia-military-institute.html?_r=0Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LLukykDuq4Highlights:""I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf.

350,"[From the washington post transcript:](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/12/transcript-the-2012-vp-debate/)> RADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up?>RYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed — six studies have verified that this math adds up. But here’s…As DragonPup indicated, PolitiFact already previously rated Romney's 5 study implication as ""mostly false."" However, since politicians are allowed to slide based on the intricacies of their language, I think it's good to look at Ryan's language in this instance. These ""studies"" he's referring to do not ""verify"" that his math stands up. They couldn't possibly, as he hasn't offered any math to verify. To quote an old [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/03/barack-obama/obama-romney-would-cut-millionaires-taxes/) which, I believe, still stands:> We need to be clear from the start that the problem independent analysts, journalists and fact-checkers have with digging into Romney's tax plan is that much of the ""plan"" isn't yet known.Since there is no concrete policy to analyze, these ""studies"" Ryan references only attempt to refute the Tax Policy Center's initial study that said the Romney-Ryan tax agenda is mathematically impossible, based on the few parameters given. They do not verify the math that Ryan has theoretically drafted.This is an incredibly important distinction. Ryan's language implies that the policy he and Romney intend to set forth not only exists but has been directly analyzed. The language of the statement, coupled with the already standing PolitiFact article, would make this a flat out ""false.""PolitiFact rated it [mostly false](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney/romney-claims-5-studies-back-his-tax-plan/) when they claimed it was 5 studies. TL;dr The 'studies' consist of op-eds, campaign material, old dataOk so it seems from the transcript Ryan said the math stands up and is corroborated by six studies. Referencing the studies: Not all of them are actually studies, and it seems that they refute the TPC Study. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to be mostly false.I think you need to be more specific.  What statement about taxes?  What studies were supposedly confirming he was ""right about taxes?""  I know you said it was in another thread but you need to include this info. or else this is way too vague to verify or debunk.This post claims these are the referenced ""six studies"" - can anyone confirm if these are them:1. Harvey Rosen paper. Rosen, a professor at Princeton, assumed Romney's lower tax rates would kickstart enough growth to pay for the revenue hole those lower tax rates would create. This seems dubious. Alan Viard and Alex Brill of the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI) have argued that it seems unlikely revenue neutral tax reform would have big growth effects -- incentives don't change much if taxes don't even if tax rates do. And besides, the Tax Policy Center used aggressive growth estimates from Romney adviser Greg Mankiw's work to test Romney's plan. It still didn't add up.2. Marty Feldstein Wall Street Journal op-ed. Former Reagan adviser and current Harvard professor Feldstein argued Romney's plan works if you assume growth would be much stronger and if you define middle class as households making less than $100,000 rather than households making less than $200,000. This latter figure is the one Romney has used when he has said his plan would not raise taxes on the middle class. 3. Marty Feldstein blog post. Feldstein was less aggressive with his growth estimates this time, but he stuck with his definition of middle class as households making less than $100,000. He also assumed Romney might cut tax preferences for employer health-insurance, make municipal bond interest taxable, and eliminate the child tax credit for households making more than $100,000.4. Matt Jensen blog post at AEI. He argued Romney might cut tax preferences for municipal bonds and life insurance buildups. But this might go against Romney's promise not to cut tax preferences for savings and investment -- and would only pay for half of Romney's revenue hole, according to the Tax Policy Center.5. Curtis Dubay blog post at Heritage. He argued Romney might cut tax preferences for municipal bonds and life insurance buildups -- yes, again -- and that Romney might tax inheritances on a ""carryover basis"" after eliminating the estate tax. In plain English, heirs would have to pay capital gains for the price an asset was bought for, rather than the price it was inherited at. But as Suzy Khimm of the Washington Post notes, Dubay overestimates how much revenue this change -- which, remember, is just a guess about what Romney would do -- would generate.6. Romney Tax Reform White Paper. This is just his advisers arguing by assertion that the plan works.http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/10/the-6-studies-paul-ryan-cited-prove-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-is-impossible/263541/"
351,"When people refer to small businesses in the context of taxation, they're typically referring to [S-corps](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/S-Corporations), which pass through profits to the owners without being taxes as a corporation.

I'm assuming profit.  Now, let's say I am the sole owner of a small defense contracting company, NTP corp.  We have a great year, win tons of contracts, and end up netting $10 million.  Then I pay myself a nice $9.9 million bonus.  How much did NTP Corp ""make""?  $100k.  Shoot, I could do the same thing with a non-profit.  So I personally categorize this as containing true information, but misleading.I guess that depends on what you consider a ""SMALL BUSINESS"" at some point, after they make enough money, aren't they a BIG BUSINESS??According to [the IRS website reporting](http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats---Integrated-Business-Data) this is false.Since the latest year they have these records for is 2003, I am going off that data.  In all sections it is much closer to 80% being sub 250k.If you go across all businesses, you have 23,972,316 that are sub 250k, and 3,514,375 that are 250k+.If Joe is ranking simply businesses it is 87% are sub 250k.But he said small businesses, typically that is an S-Corp which reports 5,333,613 sub 250k, and 1,349,599 that are 250k+.Which lowers the figure down to 80%.This statement is FALSE.Also, politifact is a horrible source for anyone to check reference on as they don't state resources used, numbers or any other documentation that this subreddit prides itself on.

I could argue for a straight false in this case, but it's certainly (at most) mostly false.It was unclear what he was referring to. I suspect he was (deliberately?) ignoring the actual power Russia and China have. The administration proposed stronger sanctions than they got because Russia vetoed them in the Security Council. Apparently with a Romney administration Russia would no longer have that veto.So what do folks think? Mostly Wrong?Agreed with the research here. Marking this false. From the research here I don't see what would offer the wiggle room to define it only as ""mostly false."""

And at that time, obviously, we'll reveal what those final decisions are as to the exact size>This strategy emerges from a deeply collaborative process.  We sought out and took insights from within and from outside the Department of Defense, to include from the intelligence community and other governmental departments.  We weighed facts and assessments.  We challenged every assumption.  We considered a wide range of recommendations and counter-arguments.  I can assure you that the steps we have taken to arrive at this strategy involved all of this and much more.    >This strategy also benefited from an exceptional amount of attention by our senior military and civilian leadership.  On multiple occasions, we held all-day and multi-day discussions with service chiefs and combatant commanders.  The service chiefs, who are charged with developing the force for the strategy, were heard early and often.  The combatant commanders, charged with executing the strategy, all weighed in time and time again. And we were all afforded extraordinary access to both the president and the secretary of defense.    >Frankly, the breadth and depth of dialogue to arrive at today's strategic choices was both necessary and noteworthy. they werent just going along with the president. the joint chiefs said it was collaborationI want this to be true. There was an article posted about how the military said they wanted fewer tanks, but I didn't look into it. Hopefully some smooth sleuths can find out for us.Well the military has certainly been downsizing personnel over the last couple of years, but I'm not sure if that's what Biden was referencing or not.I'm going to be put this at mostly true. The military and Secretary of Defense have used the terms smaller and leaner in regards to the future structure.

False.I would imagine it is true from a certain perspective, Israel wants Iran wiped off the map too but it isn't vocal about it the way many Arab countries have been about the removal of Israel. They do prefer covert means after all. So instead of fostering fear they foster hatred, this hatred motivated them to only view Arabs as the enemy. When we then send their ""enemy"" humanitarian aid, then block their further attempts at aggression in the region it confuses them as we are supposed to be their great ally and friend.So yes he is in a way correct, but in my opinion this only really services to show a bias towards another country's goals over that of his own country. Not the best platform for the VP, not to mention this mentality seriously calls into question his and his party's motivations."

If you read the armytimes.com article they say it includes Veterans as well as active but only if they put that as their employer. Since there is no verification done on the actual employer as well as them being allowed to not state if they choose, there is no way to say for sure. The armytimes.com article also states that spouses of active duty military may say that their employer is US Army or whatever.The military does not keep a total on contributions from active duty soldiers, nor is it reported anywhere but through the Federal Elections Commission and that is voluntary and does not ask if they are active duty or not.Now if the question were ""Does Ron Paul really get the most money from people who state their employer to be the military?"", the answer would be most likely be yes, you would however need to go through and do the math."
361,"The end of the debate was the real clincher for me. As far as the abortion comments go. I think Ryan really sealed it for the far right base of the GOP. I've read my share of articles about the far right not having too much enthusiasm for Romney and not to mention the conservative religious issues with voting for a Mormon instead of someone whose conservative social views are more relatable to theirs (Catholic/Methodist). I think Biden picked up the independent women vote with him basically saying that he sided with the Separation of Church and State instead of his religious beliefs. For the closing statements. About 5 seconds after I watched Ryan talk into the camera, I thought Biden blew it. It seemed like Biden made the amateur mistake that Obama did. Talking to the moderator and audience instead of the television audience. Then the more his closing statement went on, the worse it got for me. His whole cadence and tone felt incredibly insincere. I was half expecting him to finish with "" I'm Paul Ryan, and I approve this message ""The one thing I couldn't get over was Biden's attitude. He had really good points and some great responses, but the way he just kept laughing and shaking his head when Ryan spoke irked me and seemed a bit childish.

363,"10 Presidents puts us at JFK, who started in 1961.Using data from the first chart here: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/HistoricalsThe budget deficit went down in the following years:63 JFK65 Lyndon B Johnson69 Nixon73 Nixon74 Ford79 Carter 84 Reagan87 Reagan89 HW Bush93 Clinton94 Clinton95 Clinton96 Clinton97 Clinton98 Clinton99 Clinton00 Clinton05 Bush06 Bush07 Bush10 ObamaOverall, all 10 presidents were in office while the deficit was reduced. I would wager that congress has more influence over the deficit anyway, though.2009 spending was huge because of stimulus, bailouts, etc. Saying that spending less than that in 2010 is an accomplishment in deficit lowering is really disingenuous.Oh, geez, I just had a long drawn out debate over this. Here's how it works. Obama came in during FY09 (Bush's budget). It was grossly inflated and a statistical outlier due to TARP (increased spending)/economic collapse (decreased revenue). Excluding WWII (1942-1946), the highest years of deficit [as a percentage of GDP](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z2.xls) were 2009 (10.1%), 2010 (9.0%), 2011 (8.7%), 2012 and then 1983 (6.0%). So, the deficit has gone down each year, but only relative to the statistical outlier that was FY09. It's still historically large.If we use that as a baseline, then Obama has cut the deficit, though it isn't an honest baseline to use. The obligations that led to the FY09 deficit (TARP, auto bailout, etc.) wouldn't carry over into FY12. As revenue ([$2.45T](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43656) ) has almost rebounded to 2007 levels ([$2.53T](http://web.archive.org/web/20101007013716/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/hist01z1.xls)), the source of the deficit lies in spending and those spending obligations were not outside of President Obama's control. It was a calculated decision (stimulus to save the economy) that I agree with, but I don't want to couch it as ""stimulus plus deficit reduction"" when it was really ""stimulus that kept the deficit higher than historical norms for a specific purpose"".In the end, neither ""Obama's increased the deficit"" and ""Obama's decreased the deficit"" are honest statements. The situation is far too complex for four or five words. Obama's kept the deficit at a historically high level. That's in part due to the recession (lower revenue) and in part due to the response to the recession (stimulus, bailouts, etc.).I'd rank this one as statistically accurate, but lacking context. I'd say half-true.http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/HistoricalsClick Table 1.1 to download an Excel Spreadsheet of a history of our Federal government Income, Expenditures and Surpluses/Deficits. The past ten presidents, including Obama would go all the way back to John F Kennedy. I've skimmed over the deficits and Surpluses. If you're talking year to year comparisons. It seems just about every president at some point has reduced their deficit for at least one year of their administration. With possibly the exception of Gerald Ford. There was a change of what was counted as the fiscal quarter during his administration, that is listed in the spreadsheet as TQ. A site I'm reading says>Before 1977, the fiscal year ran from July 1 to June 30. For example, fiscal year 1976 began July 1, 1975 and ended June 30, 1976. The three month period, July 1, 1976 to September 30, 1976, between fiscal years 1976 and 1977 is called the transition quarter (""TQ"").Hope thats a good start.OP here. I apologize for the hiatius, I would have like to see this being evaluated in realtime. Anyway, some clarifications (and viewpoints of my own).First of all, I meant ""reduce the deficit over the course of the administration"". Sorry for the confusion.As far as some of the ""true but context matters"" arguments, I'd like to make a few points.It is true Obama started with a high baseline. However, if that alone disqualifies the reduction, what baseline should we compare him to? Essentially, the bar has been raised from ""Obama reduced the deficit"" to ""Obama reduced the deficit to historically low levels"", which is not an equivalent statement. It is argued, essentially, that Obama can't claim credit for reducing the deficit because he could have reduced it much more. Again, this is problematic because the level at which he could claim credit (the ""much more"") is fairly arbitrary.The second point is that despite the significance (or lack thereof) of Obama's reduction, it may still contribute to a wider pattern. Consider: If Obama reduced the deficit then that means all Democratic and no Republicans have reduced the deficit over the last 10 Presidents. This may be a deeply revealing statistical pattern. In fact, I'd suspect that the Democratic President/Republican Legislature combo is very deficit-friendly. But we can only examine that pattern if we can evaluate President Obama's deficit behavior.So is this ""half true"" or other? Looking over the research here to see if we're finding consensus on this....False. Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress struck a deal that brought the deficit to zero. After the Bush tax cuts, war and a few Bush programs it started to rise again.So is this true? mostly true?"
364,"I remember this issue being raised back in 2010, when people were worried that temporary high-risk insurance pool programs would provide federal funds to cover abortions outside of rape and incest (non-Hyde abortions is the legalese term); in response, HHS [released a statement](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/07/20100714d.html) effectively saying that this would not be the case. This [memo from the Congressional Research Service](http://www.peopleforlife.org/healthcare/congressionalresearchservice.pdf) to the Senate indicates that the legal language may leave some scope for the HHS Secretary to exercise her authority. However, the current Secretary has indicated that she has no intention of doing so.Well this would be in direct contradiction to the US constitution.  The federal government has no right to usurp a states laws.  This is best exemplified by Medical Marijuana laws.  While it is illegal on a federal level it is allowed at state levels.  Now I am sure someone will say ""Thats not the federal government enacting laws in states"" and this is true.  So lets look at guns.The Federal Government says that ""assault rifles"" are legal to own and so are all handguns.  Many states have bans on certain types of guns and classifications of guns.  No law passed by the federal government can override this.The HHS Secretary is also an appointed position and cannot enact laws.  The ability to create laws is strictly held by the legislature and president.  The HHS Secretary, however, CAN ENFORCE legislation as stated.  So if the ACA said that Abortions must be provided by all doctors under penalty of law, then they could make arrests and lawsuits against the doctors that didn't comply.  This is false."

I don't know the results of these lawsuits or whether the farmers really did attain Monstanto's GM crops unintentionally, so I can't evaluate your statement.>Is there evidence that they are prosecuting farmers who have unintentionally acquired transgenic DNA in their crops.You might want to follow [these guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/10q7ga/meta_can_we_get_an_update_to_guidelines_for/) for posting on this subreddit, just to make the factchecking more precise and objective.Also, what does your question have to do with Prop. 37?So is the answer here ""false"" or ""mostly false""?I don't know about the USA, but here in Brazil what they do is charge 2% in royalties in crops labeled at GM. If a crop is labeled as non GM they test it and if their test is positive they charge 3%. The problem is that these crops that are not labeled as GM but turned out to be positive can be just contaminated and that's making farmers crazy. Monsanto is being sued in billions of USD.http://www.gmwatch.org/latest-listing/1-news-items/14091There are rumors that Monsanto, with the US government, is also behind the impeachment of former Paraguay President Fernando Lugo. He forbade Monsanto to charge the royalties there. One of the first things the new president did, was to allow it. But as I said, rumors. I doubt a simple search on google would suffice to check this fact.[Unfilter podcast on the issue](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/21341/meet-monsanto-unfilter-8/)I'm too tired to listen to the whole thing again & get the time, but they discuss the fact that there's an internally named ""Seed Team"" of lawyers whose sole job is to sue farmers who have their crops growing on their land, whether they wanted them or not.  I cant remember the source, but they cite it.Good listen to anyone genuinely interested.In the documentary The Future of Food, they interviewed a Canadian farmer who talks about being sued by Monsato.

366,"Yes, this is true in the sense that TLC used to offer educational program blocks as a part of its programming which have very recently been [shipped to other channels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Set_Learn) and replaced with its current programs, [none of which look or sound educational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_TLC). Ideally you'd want to compare TV guides from the '80s, '90s and today, but so far as I can tell those aren't available online (if someone has access to [this book](http://www.alibris.com/search/books/isbn/9780345497734), maybe they could shed some light?).Bear in mind though that PBS receives funding [from a variety of sources](http://www.pbs.org/producing/funding/), of which about 15% is from the federal government. So far as I can tell, TLC started off as a wholly publicly-funded company that was then fully privatized in 1980. You could argue that the two situations are incomparable, seeing as PBS already has private sources of funding and only a relatively small component of its programming is funded by the federal government. It's possible that PBS can maintain its current programming standards, even if the federal government withdraws its contribution to funding the channel, without falling into the same fate as TLC. That being said, the question and source only talk about TLC's programming history, and I would rate the historical account as True.> Then it was privatized in 1980 ( modern version is the Reaganism the gOP pushes) and was then named the Appalachian Community Service Network. In November 1980 this name was changed to “The Learning Channel”, which was subsequently shortened to “TLC.”Reagan didn't take office until 1981. This kind of partisan smearing makes me more skeptical of the rest of the article.So it seems like we confirmed this and I see no counter-evidence, but I'll mark it now as ""mostly true"" purely as the original fact-check asks if the content went from ""educating to exploitative"" shows. The less than precise term ""exploitative shows"" makes this one harder to mark as 100 percent confirmed, but rather ""mostly true."""

368,"What Romney was talking about was that the [Labor Force Participation Rate](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/) has dropped.  Last month it was lower than it had been since 1981.If you look at the difference in the labor force participation rate between June 2009 when the recession ended, and current, there are roughly 5.1 million people who are no longer being counted as part of the labor force.The current number of ""official"" U-3 unemployed is 12.1 million people, on an official labor force of 155.1 million, which gives us a U-3 unemployment rate of 7.8% for September....however, if those 5.1 million people are counted, the numbers then become 17.2 million unemployed in a labor force of 160.2 million, which is 10.7%.  Last month, the U-3 unemployment rate was 8.1% and the labor force participation rate slightly lower, which would have put the number with the missing workers at almost exactly 11%.This is always true--The U6 rate including those dropping out has to, by definition, by higher (or no less than the same) than the U3 rate which is the actual unemployment rate based on the UI rolls. The U3 rate is very accurate--it can be counted.  The U6 rate may include those who drop out for personal as opposed to economic reasons.  The key is consistency.  Use one or the other rate consistently, whether you are talking about yourself or the other guy, about Massachusetts or the U.S., about the U.S. under Bush or since Bush.There are [multiple measurements used to track unemployment](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm), and by *all* of them, Romney is wrong.The standard one (and where you hear the 7.8 number) is U-3.If we're including ""Discouraged workers"" people who've stopped looking for a job, plus ""marginally attached workers"", that number goes up to 9.3, not 11 (U-5).If we're including all of those *and* everyone who's underemployed, that number goes up to 14.7... but if Romney meant that number, he would have said, ""15"".The thing is, any of those latter measurements would have been misleading because the unemployment number people would undoubtedly be comparing it to from before the recession is the U3 rate. He's essentially inviting people to compare apples and oranges. If Romney is implying that his repeated argument that unemployment hasn't gone below 8% since Obama took office still holds true, then he's pointing to one measurement when he knows people are thinking about another (U-6 unemployment numbers, incidentally, haven't gone below 8% since the early 2000s).So what Romney is saying is not technically true for any standard measurement, and even if it was, it would be misleading.People who have dropped out of the workforce are **never** included in unemployment figures, so no, that would not be the ""real"" unemployment rate. It is *always* the case that the figure would be higher if you included people who aren't looking for work, and this applies to every country's unemployment numbers. It is not true that 11% reflects a ""real"" unemployment rate, or that a ""real"" rate would include people who are not actively seeking employment.http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htmU-5 is 9.3 and U-6 is 14.7. Those emphasize people underemployed and stopped looking for work. This could be hard to measure so you could low ball it around 10 or 11Actual U6 unemployment [remains over 14%](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10zqzh/u6_unemployment_numbers_real_unemployment_remains/), so Romney seems to have picked a value between the reported U3 value and the value he was going for.Let's see.... 7.8 vs 14.7... the middle is 11.25, so technically, he is wrong, 7.8 is closer to 11 than 14.7 is.The context of Romney's quote is ""since President Obama took office"".keypuncher's [link for the labor force participation rate](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/) shows that it was 65.7% in January 2009 and 63.6% in September 2012; this is out of a September labor force size of [155,063,000](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11000000/).The 2.1% drop in the participation rate corresponds to 155,063,000 x 2.1/63.6 = 5,120,000 missing from the labor force.Adding them to the [12,088,000](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS13000000/) currently unemployed gives 17,308,000.  Dividing that into the hypothetical 154,236,000 + 5,120,000 labor force size would give an unemployment rate of 10.9%.10.9% is indeed closer to 11% than 7.8% is, as Romney claimed.However, Romney did **not** claim that ""if the labor force participation rate had remained the same..."", he claimed ""If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force...""  The labor force size last month was some 827,000 **greater** than its 154,236,000 size in January 2009, so there's no evidence in these figures of there being anyone who was in the labor force at the time of Obama's inauguration not being in it last month, and so there are no net leavers to add back in to the ranks of the unemployed and the labor force.I suggest that Romney or his speechwriters completely flubbed the context, but got the gist right.Why does it matter?  If you have an established metric you can't decide to redefine the metric when it doesn't say what you want it to say.  ""Unemployment rate"" is established and published each month.  Now they can't say unemployment is over 8% so that have to say something else.  ""Oh shit that number we were looking at doesn't look so bad anymore. Let's find something else.""  Here's a new number but it takes an hour of calculations to get there on your own""  Please"

370,"Is the board you're referring to the [Independent Payment Advisory Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Payment_Advisory_Board)? If so, yes, that is a provision under the Affordable Care Act that's intended to look at Medicare spending per-capita over a 5 year period and determine how to limit that growth rate. However, I believe there are provisions that prevent it from rationing health care to reduce costs, so the board doesn't limit treatments for very sick people.Section 3403 of the [PPACA](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3590) covers the IPAB, but I can't find a ~~single~~ standalone PDF or document that isolates that section of the bill, sorry.The closest thing to what you're talking about, and what Romney was likely referring to in the debate last night, is the Independent Medicare Advisory Board (later renamed to the Independent Payment Advisory Board), as ksanch points out. You can see it in the actual bill [here](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426).However, unlike how Romney portrayed it (in a somewhat more nuanced way than others before with the ""death panel"" name), the boards purpose is an *advisory* one, like it says in the name. They create recommendations, Congress votes on it, and the President can veto it.What's more, they are *specifically* told that their recommendation will **not** ration health care, raise premiums or co-pays, restrict benefits, or restrict eligibility. In other words, they need to find ways to save money *without* reducing care for patients.So yes, Obamacare created a board to save money, but no, it *doesn't* limit treatments to *anyone*. In fact, it is expressly forbidden from doing so.No. This is just a reheated version of Sarah Palin's ""Death Panel"" lies, designed to appeal to extremely low-information voters.I've read the sources posted in here, and I am going on the assumption that these are what the original poster was mentioning. It appears to be false so I'm going to label it so, since this thread is a few days old. If new information is posted that would change the flair, I'll look it over and go from there.Maybe you are thinking of something that was somewhat quietly put in place before the ACA was even voted on.http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&refer=columnist_mccaughey&sid=aLzfDxfbwhzsThe stimulus bill does that, and calls it the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (190-192). The goal, Daschle’s book explained, is to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies because they are driving up costs. He praises Europeans for being more willing to accept “hopeless diagnoses” and “forgo experimental treatments,” and he chastises Americans for expecting too much from the health-care system."
371,"Laffer did not base the curve on empirical evidence but on the valid argument that revenue is 0 at 0% and 100% taxation and because it is non-zero at observed points in between there must be a curve.the 20% he pulled out of his ass.There probibly is a Laffer curve and a magic percentage but no evidence for it being 20%. Most likely it is variable and dependent on rate of growth of the economy. summary there can be diminishing returns in taxation TRUE.that 20% is the magic number no evidence so FALSE.Even should the Laffer curve be true, it assumes that revenue does not level off until a 50% rate.

Given your particular business environment and your tax rates, people decide where to put their money.   If your business environment is way way better than the rest of the world, you could probably get away with higher taxes.   If your business environment is worse, you need lower taxes to attract business.The key for someone deciding to more or stay, or invest or not, is ""how much money do I get to keep for doing job X"".  (There are probably non-economic factors, too, such as quality of life, freedom, safety, etc).Given the graph linked above, I would say that the claim should be: ""given the current world competitive environment and the business climate in the US, it is highly unlikely that the federal government could collect more than 20% of GDP in taxes over any extended period"".As written, I would rank it as probably true.I'd ask for some clarification first.

That would be hard to determine.My fact-checkfu is still weak, but I would like to know the answer to this myself.Well: while at Bain, we seem to have documented here that they seem confirmed to have sent jobs overseas, in part for lower cost workers. So by the letter of the question: maybe confirmed? Or mostly true, if we feel we have not found evidence that their overseas choice was motivated by cost savings. What do folks think?I think we have found enough here to count this as ""mostly true""  at Bain Romney did outsource jobs from US businesses to overseas. One likely motive for this was cost efficiency. But it is ""mostly"" true as we cannot verify that this would have been the primary or only reason for the choice."

That word is kinda used fast 'n loose.It may be true but it's a straw man.  The point of these loan programs is to take the higher risk that banks won't take.  It's done because it's long term good for the country not because it's might make a near term profit.  The right always thinks like that.  Let's say the $35B was flushed down the toilet.

376,"The federal funding which PBS receives is not direct; the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_for_Public_Broadcasting) is entirely federally funded and is responsible for disbursing federal funds to a variety of public TV and radio stations (its annual budget is ~$450 million a year), but the actual public broadcasting stations do get money from private donors, universities, local/state governments, and a variety of other sources. On aggregate, federal funds make up 15-20% of the total revenue collected by these public broadcasting stations, but for individual stations that number can vary. Unfortunately, [PBS' financial statements](http://www.pbs.org/about/media/about/cms_page_media/29/PBS%20Financial%20Report%202011.pdf) do not indicate how much of their revenue comes from federal grants, and the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting's operating budget](http://www.cpb.org/aboutcpb/financials/budget/) does not reveal how much money it disburses to PBS. My estimate is that at most 15% of PBS' funding comes from direct federal funding, but the actual percentage is probably less (if you want me to explain the math, let me know!)Now, it's true that the US borrows money from China, and it's true that the federal government partly funds PBS. It's not the case though that the US sends a letter out to Chinese investors asking them to borrow funds to keep Big Bird on air. On that basis, I would rate this as False.Much of what our government does is financed by government bonds.  So technically you could say we borrow from China to do anything.  You could also say the government borrows from anyone who owns a U.S. treasury bond.  You could also say the same thing for every country on Earth.However, the thing that makes a lie is intent to deceive, and I think it's fairly deceitful for anyone with knowledge of global financial markets to say this outside of an illustrative context.  So, I would say this statement is true, and a lie.[""**Funding for PBS programs comes from a variety of sources - member stations' dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, government agencies, foundations, corporations and private citizens.**""](http://www.pbs.org/producing/funding/).

The United States is funding PBS.  We are, essentially, borrowing money in order to spend it on PBS.That was Romney's whole point.This submission ought to be rated ""true""...but this subreddit hasn't been living up to its promise.Maybe given the multiple sources of funding PBS sees, we'd call this half true?

377,"[This document](http://www.elistore.org/Data/products/d19_07.pdf) highlights all forms of financial assistance the government has provided to both fossil fuel and renewables producers between 2002-2008. If you define subsidies as 'direct financial assistance such as lump sum payments provided to producers to assist their operations' then yes, there are no subsidies provided to producers (there ARE subsidies provided to consumers though, such as LIHEAP). Most forms of assistance come as tax credits and tax deductions. If however you relax your definition of subsidy and look for provisions where the government forgoes revenue it otherwise would have collected under tax law, then oil and natural gas industries do clearly obtain financial assistance from the government, through tax credits and tax deductions. I also think from the standpoint of economic theory tax credits and subsidies are treated as equivalents (though I'm not sure about this, and hopefully someone could verify). I would rate this statement as Half True - while the government does not give direct subsidies to oil and natural gas producers, the underlying insinuation that the government does not provide ANY financial assistance to fossil fuels producers is incorrect - not to mention, consumer-oriented subsidies do exist.How about the CBO?[http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-06-FuelsandEnergy_Brief.pdf](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-06-FuelsandEnergy_Brief.pdf)""Tax preferences for energy were first established in 1916,and until 2005 they were primarily intended to stimulatedomestic production of oil and natural gas.

He adds that when he tried to go after a company for the royalties they owed, he received phone calls from Congressional offices leaning on him to side with industry.Royalty Relief Acthttp://www.pbs.org/now/shows/224/royalty-relief.html>>**What is royalty relief?**>>In 1995 Congress passed the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, which granted a royalty ""holiday"" to oil and gas companies drilling in deep waters for leases sold between 1996 and 2000. The act reduced the amount of royalties that companies had to pay for drilling in American waters in the Gulf of Mexico. At the time when gas prices were fairly low, the move was seen by many as an incentive to get petroleum companies to drill for oil and natural gas and keep energy production inside the United States.>>Further royalty relief came after the Act expired in 2001, with Gale A. Norton, who was interior secretary. She offered royalty incentives to shallow-water producers in 2004.>>Last year, President Bush signed an energy bill that contained $2.6 billion in new tax breaks for oil and gas drillers and a modest expansion of the 10-year-old royalty relief program, according to the New York Times.>>**How much were royalties before the Act?**>>For much of the past century, oil and gas companies had agreed to pay at least 12 percent in royalties for a lease to drill on public land or water. Over the years, those royalty payments have generated over $100 billion in revenues. Under the royalty relief program companies do not have to pay that 12 percent on up to 87.5 million barrels of oil, except when market prices reach $34 a barrel and for natural gas when prices climb above $4 per thousand cubic feet.>>**Where does the royalty money go?**>>The great majority of it goes to the general US Treasury. A small portion of the funds go to the Historical Preservation Trust Fund and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Many states and Indian tribes also benefit from oil and gas royalty payments from drilling done on state-owned or Indian-owned properties.>>**How much money will the government lose?**>>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has estimated that, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit by the Kerr-McGee Corporation, the government could lose a total of $80 billion over the next 25 years.>>Part of the reason why the number is so high is because of a major clerical mistake made on about 1,000 leases that the Clinton administration signed with oil and gas companies in 1998 and 1999. The Interior Department omitted the restriction that incentives were supposed to stop when prices for oil reached $34 a barrel and prices for natural gas climbed above $4 per thousand cubic feet.>>**Why is the Kerr-McGee Corporation suing the Bush Administration?**>>The company argues that Congress never authorized the government to set price cut-offs for incentives on leases awarded from 1996 to 2000 because it had not yet produced the minimum volume required under the law to be royalty-free. ""The government is trying to take away the guarantees that were enacted by Congress,"" the company said in a statement. [Requires Adobe Reader]>>If the company wins the suit, which is considered a test case for the oil and gas industry, about three-quarters of oil and gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico will be royalty free for the next five years, The New York Times reports.>>**Were oil companies ever sued in the past for not paying royalties?**>>Yes. In the 1990s, the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, along with a number of industry insiders, sued to try to win back missing royalty payments. More than a dozen oil companies, while not admitting any wrongdoing, paid over $400 million to settle the case.[Try this.](http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/energy/subsidies/)[Obama calls to end oil subsidies.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-calls-on-congress-to-repeal-federal-subsidies-for-oil-industry/2012/03/01/gIQArDU2kR_story.html)[A third article.](http://priceofoil.org/fossil-fuel-subsidies/)I'm going to rate this as False.

The conventional agreement is that Tax Credits/Breaks can be studies. There does not seem to be any precise well agreed textbook definition of a subsidy for us to reference.

378,"AEI, the same group that can say Romney's tax plan would not force a middle class tax break, does magic again.The rate on this debt isn't 2.6, a good chunk of it has been under well below that, and even in negative rate - yes, investors are looking for safe harbor. GDP growth isn't taken into account, or health care improvements, assumption here being that the burden of servicing debt remains constant over time.Lies.My aunt received this from the Romney campaign. Figured I'd let you guys have a crack at it. Here's the letter accompanying it:*The Cost Of Obama’s Debt: $4,000 in Middle-Class Tax IncreasesTo view online, click here: http://mi.tt/U7QdrrPierce ScrantonA new, nonpartisan study has just examined what would be required from taxpayers just to continue making interest payments on the increased debt President Obama is responsible for and has proposed. The study concluded that the debt President Obama is responsible for and has proposed amounts to a $4,000 tax increase each year for a middle class family. Here’s how it breaks down. The cost of servicing the debt that has already accumulated under President Obama would require $1,600 in additional taxes from a middle-class family each year. The cost of the debt he’s proposed to add over the next decade would require an additional $2,500 in taxes each year.This study isn’t just piling the burden onto the middle class either. High-income households would pay almost 25 times that amount each year. But the pain would also have to be spread to lower-income households. A family making between $20,000 and $30,000 would see their taxes increase by $770 each year. A family making between $30,000 and $40,000 would see their taxes increase by more than $1,000 each year. This tax increase far exceeds the amount the President claims to have provided in temporary tax relief, and keep in mind that this projection uses the President’s own budget, so it already assumes that all of the President’s job-destroying tax increases have become law.Despite promising to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term, President Obama has presided over four consecutive years of trillion-dollar deficits. At the end of September, President Obama had added more than $5.4 trillion to the debt. You can see for yourself right here. If that weren’t enough, the President’s own budget proposes adding another $9.2 trillion over the next decade. Unless the President plans for the country to default on its debt, that’s borrowed money that we have to pay back. Based on the current population, our nation’s $16 trillion debt adds up to more than $51,000 in taxes for every man, woman and child in the country.How does the President propose to deal with our fiscal crisis? That’s a good question. The short answer is that he doesn’t have a plan. He pretends that he’s only responsible for 10 percent of the increase (a claim that has already been discredited here, and here). His budget was rejected unanimously by Congress—414-0 in the House and 99-0 in the Senate. That’s a case study in failed leadership, not a plan for tackling one of the most pressing issues facing the country. Not a single Democrat in Congress supported his budget. And for good reason.Under the President’s budget, the national debt would increase to $20 trillion at the end of a second Obama Administration, or 106% of GDP. To put that number into perspective, Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio will hit 90.5% by the end of 2013. Under the President’s budget, spending actually gets larger as a share of the economy at the end of ten years going from 22.3% of GDP in 2016 to 22.6% of GDP in 2022. At the same time, the President’s stated policy is to do nothing to address the solvency of entitlement programs like Social Security that will only make matters worse.It’s time for a new plan and Governor Romney has one that will get spending under control and gets our budget back to balance within ten years.Pierce Scranton is the Economic Policy Director for Romney for President, Inc.*If you want to check the claim ""A new, nonpartisan study has found that a $4,000 middle class tax increase would be required from taxpayers to continue making interest payments on the increased debt President Obama is responsible for and has proposed"", then it's immediately false. The Romney campaign tells an overt lie in the **third word** of this release.>A new, **nonpartisan study**AKA The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (really rolls off the tongue)>The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI) is an American **conservative think tank** founded in 1943. Some AEI scholars are considered to be some of the leading architects of the second Bush administration's public policy. **More than twenty** AEI scholars and fellows served either in a Bush administration policy post or on one of the government's many panels and commissions.

379,"I found this:http://votesmart.org/bill/13021/34320/5121/government-shutdown-prevention-act#.UGxO7k3R6SoHe voted YEA.>**Highlights:**>-Specifies that in the event of a government shutdown, salaries for the President of the United States and for members of Congress shall not be paid for the duration of the shutdown (Sec. 3).So it would appear that Powell was wrong about the pay for congress part. No idea about pay for military.From what I've read, Congress gets paid by mandatory appropriations. So for them to not get payed, they have to introduce legislation that has that specific purpose. There is [H.R. 1255 - Government Shutdown Prevention Act](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h224)The text of the bill states>(a) Treatment of Members During a Government Shutdown- The Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, respectively, shall not disburse to each Member or Delegate the amount of his or her salary for each day that-->(1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution; or>(2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit under section 3101 of title 31, United States Code, has been reached.He voted YES on this Bill.An effort by House Republicans to shut the Senate out of the budget process.

380,"Snopes has entries for a few of these, marked as false.  - For the first item, Obama did not receive college aid as a foreign student. The article that started that rumor rolling was an April Fools' hoax. - He did not cancel the National Day of Prayer. In fact, when the Freedom from Religion foundation legally challenged the event, the Obama administration was the *defendant*. - Regarding the claim about Michelle's ""personal servants"", she in fact has 22-24 staffers working for her; however, Laura Bush had 24-26, Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford had about 30, and Jackie Kennedy had about 40.1) First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner.- False; he never applied for college aid as a foreigner.http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/occidental.asp 2) First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in.- False; this was based on a failed birther rumor.http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/ssn.asp 3) First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States- True; however the reason the credit rating was reduced was due to inaction by Congress and The Senate, not due to any efforts or lack thereof on the part of the President.http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sandp-considering-first-downgrade-of-us-credit-rating/2011/08/05/gIQAqKeIxI_story.html 4) First President to violate the War Powers Act.- Possible; although he would not be the first to do; this in regards to whether or not the US involvement in Libya was in a support role or a direct intervention role.  Ultimately Congress dropped the discussion quite abruptly.  But the bigger issue - whether the action was a violation or not - would also call into question dozens of other military actions taken by US Presidents since 1973 without direct congressional approval.  If it was indeed a violation of the War Powers Act then it wasn't the first. 5) First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .- Probably false; I have found no DIRECT evidence that the administration was held in contempt of court over the drilling issue - just two opinion pieces that says the administration was without citation.  Also worth noting if he even was he was not the first President to be held in contempt of court: Clinton and Nixon both were as well.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/23/energy-obamanomics-no-green-jobs-and-plenty-of-red/http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/2011/04/there-magic-formula-lower-gas-pricesAnd it looks like this is a case of mangling the facts: http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/senator-mangles-facts-on-drilling-moratorium/ 6) First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party.- Semantics; Technically the Supreme Court decided that the Health Insurance requirement of the ACA is a tax.  Also technically false in that not all Americans are required to purchase health care: those within a certain income bracket and age range are exempted as well as those who qualify for Medicare.Overall: mostly false.7) First President to spend a trillion dollars on ‘shovel-ready’ jobs when there was no such thing as ‘shovel-ready’ jobs. ...- First part false, second part somewhat true;  First of all the stimulus, which this is referring to, was not a trillion dollars.  It was $800 billion and only $105 billion of that was spent on 'shovel-ready' infrastructure jobs.  The somewhat true part is that it wasn't truly spent on 'shovel-ready' jobs, it was mostly spent on other appropriations, with only 1/8th of the money going directly to infrastructure.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009#Infrastructure_Investment8) First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.- False?  I'm not even certain what this claim is saying.  It is entirely supposition and opinion driven.  It is based upon the way GM paid off its debts when it went into bankruptcy but it certainly was not based on the control of the Union or direct control by Obama:http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-creditors-sue-usover-15-billion-dispute-2011-06-08http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/uaw-defends-itself-and-takes-on-gm-bondholders/9) First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.- Half true, half false; It is true that he is the first President to implement the DREAM Act - mainly because it was his administration that proposed it.  He did not, however, bypass congress to implement it - he issued an order implementing part of it on June 15, 2012.  But he certainly wasn't the first President to do so, not by a long shot.  Executive Orders have been a tool of Presidents to bypass the Legislative branch for a long time.  Reagan was quite famous for it.10) First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S. , including those with criminal convictions.- False; simply because you cannot prove that a secret amnesty program exists or doesn't exist.  There was a change in amnesty programs by the DHS that SPED UP the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, however:http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/us/deportation-cases-of-illegal-immigrants-to-be-reviewed.html?_r=2&hp 11) First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees.- False; this is in reference to the REQUEST made by the Administration for BP to start a 20 billion dollar fund for victims of the oil disaster.  BP agreed without any reservation.  No demands were made and the money was not turned over to a political appointee but put into a recovery fund.12) First President to tell a CEO of a major corporation (Chrysler) to resign.- True; as part of the bailout deal the administration did request that GM CEO Richard Wagner resign from his post after an 8 year decline in management.  Whether or not the Administration is the first to do this is unknown.13) First President to terminate America ‘s ability to put a man in space.- False; The Shuttle program was terminated by Bush:http://www.spacedaily.com/news/rocketscience-05o.html 14) First President to cancel the National Day of Prayer and to say that America is no longer a Christian nation.- Both patently false.http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/prayerday.asp15) First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.- True; the President was in another country when Congress and the Senate finally passed a bill hours before it was set to expire.  If he hadn't signed it via auto-pen it would have sent  the legislation into expiration (Congress waited until 15 minutes before it was due before passing it.)  So, once again, he broke this first due to  the GOP and Democrats in the legislative branch being unable to agree.16) First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.- True and false;  The President did declare that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional and refused to enforce it but this was not arbitrarily.  The Federal Courts, who make these determinations legally, sided with the Administration and now the Act is awaiting appeal in the US Supreme Court.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act 17) First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly spoke-out on the reasons for their rate increases.- True that he is the first president to threaten insurance companies with loss of their anti-trust exemptions; false that he is the first president to threaten this; and false that it was over rate increases.  It was, in truth, over deceptive ads released by the insurance industry.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/us/politics/18address.html18) First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state it is allowed to locate a factory.- Not sure what this is referencing, too vague. 19) First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN).- False; the Federal Government has sued the states hundreds of times.http://video.foxnews.com/v/4281898/when-has-the-federal-government-sued-a-state/One or two (First president to oversee credit rating downgrade) are true, most are false or mostly false (pays $102,000 for a dog trainer on retainer, or implementing the DREAM act by fiat), and some are partisan bias (surrounds himself with radical left wing anarchists, filing lawsuits against states he swore to protect).Rather than evaluate them all here, I suggest you start individual threads for each claim that you can't verify yourself. This makes it easier to fact check and makes it easier for everyone else to see which specific claims in this document are true or false. Otherwise, we'd just slap a 'false' label and miss all the claims with partisan bias or are true/half true, and I think it would be helpful for the readers of this subreddit to see how each individual claim gets evaluated.The War Powers Act one was in regards to the US actions in Libya.  The Act limits the President's authority to wage war to 90 days without the consent of Congress.  The US military was involved with the conflict in Libya for well over 90 days.  Obama maintained that since it wasn't consecutive days of conflict and since we weren't using ground troops, the Act didn't apply.  There were plenty of people who did not agree with him though and felt he was in violation.It's worth noting that Congress had the ability to do a few things about it, but just about everything they tried to do was voted down. * War Powers Act: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution* White House Claiming the Act doesn't apply: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/us/politics/16powers.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0* Congress' actions in response: http://www.propublica.org/blog/item/whatever-happened-to-the-war-powers-actEdit: A few additional things:* There's a debate over whether the War Powers Resolution is in itself Constitutional.  As it constrains executive power, most presidents tend to side on the belief that it's unconstitutional.* Whether or not Obama violated the act is somewhat up for debate, but this certainly isn't the first time that a president has been accused of violating the Act.  Reagan in El Salvador and Clinton in Kosovo both were accused of being in violation.* I can't find a source for it, but I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that most of Congress didn't actually want to have to vote on whether or not to continue the conflict in Libya (which is why most of the efforts to do anything about it were ineffective).It is full of fail from start to finish. It would be easier to see if someone could find one that they might be able to verify.I'll take one ... the SS number one to start.  I don't know his social security number ... but these are the rules on the numbers:>The Area Number (first three digits) is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Since 1972, when SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from Baltimore, the area number assigned has been based on the ZIP code in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address does not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the Area Number does not necessarily represent the State of residence of the applicant, either prior to 1972 or since.Sauce: http://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.htmlAnd as far as the president being found in contempt of court ... I found this source:http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/senator-mangles-facts-on-drilling-moratorium/The larger question for the sender of this email: Why are there no links or references to these accusations?Man, I despise it when people just drop lists like this. Each one of these issues requires research to debunk, and there is no way to go through all of them in a live debate. Plus, doing them all in list form is worthless in a write debate, your opponent can just deflect whenever they are proven wrong. They just brute force everything. It is utter bullshit, it is NOT how mature adults have discussions, and you should call her out on it.If I received an email like that, I would not even waste time bothering to check them all.  I would ask for proof on each one of them, and most likely you will not get an answer, which just states the obvious, they probably are not true. If they do come back with sources, fact check them.

Also, no demand - it was a request that was honored immediately. Technically false, but based in truth.* Unconstitutional: True but badly phrased.

381,"Tl;dr: U.S.A has been in some form of war for 212 of its 236 years which is about 90%. Sorry about the long post but I was thorough.Well if we consider 1776 the start of the U.S. it has been 236 years since the U.S. was independant as its own country. The Revolutionary war started in 1774 but lets ignore those first two years since we are starting in 1776 it ended in 1783 so our total for years in war is 7We were also involved in the Chickamuaga Wars which went on until 1794 meaning we were actually at war techinally for another 11 years bringing the total to 18Add another year for the Northwest Indian War for a total of 19 years of war out of 19 years since the Declaration was signed.The Franco American war went from 1798-1800 so that is another 3 years  brnging the total to 22 years of War and 3 of no war.The First Barbary war went from 1801 to 1805 adding another 5 years making it 27 years of war.In 1811, Tecumsehs War was only 3 months, but I am counting by year so make it 28 total.The War of 1812 went from 1812-1815 meaning we now have 31 years of war.First Seminole war went from 1817-1818 so total is 33 years.War against Indies Piracy and African Slave operations went on from 1817-1825 and 1819-1861. Eliminating redudant years we have another 42 years of techinal war so a grand total of 75 years. Inbetween these time many other wars were going on.The Navajo Wars went from 1858- 1866 so add 5 more years for a grand total of 80.Apache Wars went from 1851-1900 so eliminating redudancy we have another 34 years. So 114 years of war so far.The Phillipine-American war went adds another 2 years as it ended in 1902. Total: 116 The Moro Rebellion went until 1913 so add another 11 years for a total of 127 years.Nicaraguan Campaign went on until 1933 and Haitian campaign until 1934 so add another 21 years for a total of 148 years.There is a break until the start of the U.S. involvement in WW2 adding 4 years for 152 years.The Cold War went from '47 until '91 so add on another 44 years for 196 years of war.Iraqui no flight zones went from '95-'03 meaning another 8 years for 204 years of war.Finally the War on Terror has been going on since 2001 so removing 2 years we have another 8 years. So 212 out 236 we have been in war. Some simple math shows we have been in 89.8% of our exsistance, which rounds up to 90%.Could be true, but find me a superpower that *isn't* constantly in conflicts""Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance.

The cuckoo clock."" --Harry LimeSo i'm hearing this feels at LEAST Mostly True, if not Confirmed?"
382,"I'm going to rate this as Half True. As the claim relies on the actions of Congress. If the Bush Era Tax cuts do expire, there will be a tax hike. But as for it being probable or certain is an unknown.[The article that Breibart links to](http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/259505-report-nine-in-10-would-see-tax-increase-from-fiscal-cliff) shows that they are talking about the Bush era tax cuts INCLUDING the payroll tax.  So presuming that 90% of households are employed, this would be a fairly accurate statistic.  The problem is the way the study was formulated.  They simply said 9 in 10 households will be effected.  This isn't an exact percentage so to say 90% is somewhat misleading.Given it isn't a partisan bias, this appears to be a half truth.[Link to what I think is the ""study"" referenced](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/09/26-fiscal-cliff-frenzel).  It appears to be an opinion piece backed by some statistically founded elements (Bush tax cuts will expire, payroll taxes will increase unless congress acts).It's half-true or mostly false because it assumes all the Bush tax cuts will expire, which isn't likely (Even Obama only wants some of them to expire).It is a possibility, but any claims that it WILL happen are bs since neither side wants everything to expire.EDIT: Wanna explain the downvote? Those taxes are not guaranteed to occur so saying that all households WILL get a tax hike cannot be a true statement. Even mostly true isn't acceptable since its a low possibility of them expiring in full."
383,"Note that the original letter being quoted from is [here](http://www.wnd.com/files/Focusletter.pdf).  This is necessary because the linked article does not include every claim in the letter.

384,"I would think that something along the lines of a unique post for each question, or even response would be the best way to handle the debates in a way that allows quick access and time/visibility for thorough accuracy. In addition to those individual threads, a game day thread along the lines of what the sports subreddits do would be great because we could open it as a www.reddit-stream.com thread. An IRC channel wouldn't be crazy either although it lacks the permanence of a post.OK just posted the plan here: http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/10ty13/politicalfactchecking_subreddit_debate_plan_for/ Thanks everybody...This is all in the spirit of brainstorming, but what would you think of a combo of this:1. one live thread, and everyone can post AS A COMMENT the fact claim you think most worthy of being fact checked and as much quoting verbatim as possible.... Then users vote up the ones they find the most compelling, and we mods would very quickly post the top let say 3 or 5 of them in the formats we do as usual.2. This allows for the group to vote up the most compelling, and lets everyone cover and comment live what they think on each, but once a ""comment/fact-claim"" get's a critical mass of upvotes we turn it into it's own stand alone post/thread.What do folks think of that idea?How about one parent thread per debate with a main comment which links to individual posts/questions listed chronologically. Each individual post would behave like normal. It would be very difficult to find the statement you are interested in since the front page will soon be overrun by facts to check and will only hold the most popular (upvoted) ones which is not necessarily what someone is looking for. Having the parent thread would allow someone to easily do a search in one place for the statement they are looking for.Reddit is fantastic for finding hot topics but lousy at organizing data. A parent thread would bring order to the chaos that would ensue from a flurry of facts flying all around.My best idea is one thread, encouraging all participants to use reddit-stream (works amazingly on r/cfb), and as different statements are made, participants can make comments about facts being asserted as top-tier comments, followed by fact-checking replies. Basically, the way this subreddit works, shrunk down into a single post.in addition to prompt checking of facts - I suggest having pen and paper with stamped envelope ready to send to the debate networks (and candidates) for letting blatant falsehoods slide.How about IRC? Open forum where everyone can talk and comment, that way things can be discussed in there and then posted into the thread?Try to get a topic in like /r/politics or /r/news or something similar voted high enough to be on the main page, which will then be updated by a mod who is compiling all the fact checking done in this subreddit?"
385,"Since we're being meta, I just wanted to ask whether non-USA questions are welcome here.Great and very constructive suggestions all very much in the spirit of the effort here. (No toes stepped on whatsoever)... let us digest these and respond more, but wanted to put the first reaction as ""Thank you, you completely get what we are working to build here....""This is great. It might be worth adding something about questions that rely upon controversial social-scientific theories in order to answer well. Many questions about, say, the effects of various tax schemes or government expenditures on the economy, even specific sectors of the economy, cannot be answered without appealing to economic theories that are by no means well established. The same goes for questions regarding programs concerning poverty, only the theories may include those of sociology as well as economics. I'm not by any measure denigrating the social sciences; rather, I don't think we can rely on some of their theories in the same way that we can rely on, say, evolution by means of natural selection.I still believe that >Person X said that he created 5,000 jobs in the US during 2010, is this true? should more appropriately be submitted as >Person X created 5,000 jobs in the US during 2010""Is this true"" is unnecessary. That question is implicit in submission. Including ""Person X said"" is misleading, because in this case whether they said something is not the claim being checked."
386,"I hear a little of both names FWIW.  Ultimately though, why does this even matter?!I say Unverifiable simply because they claim MSNBC was ""intentionally"" dishonest. Without probing the mind of whatever producer put the clip together we're stuck.I want to say False, just by Hanlon's razor. Romney and Ryan sound similar. Joe Scarborough is a conservative, and he thought they were saying ""Ryan"". But in the interests of neutrality, this is simply Unverifiable.It is ""unverifiable"", there is no way to answer what MSNBC was trying to do unless someone happens to have a contact to the producer of this segment who will answer truthfully. Nothing else matters in article because you cannot fact check what someone was thinking or trying to do.Have to admit when I hear the orignal C-SPAN tape, I only hear ""Ryan"" and all the other comments I've heard on this seem highly annecdotal. This has gotten lots of pick up in the blogosphere, though and was curious what we could find on it more concretely.You don't think it's possible that... by some chance... people were shouting 2 syllable last names that both begin with R... simultaneously?  Could that be?From the sound of it Romney didn't want them shouting them both together.As a left leaning person, though, it seems that some people just started shouting Ryan first... but... I'm not going to do some sort of soundfield analysis on the thing.Um...the 4 or 5 times I've heard it it definately sounded like Romney, Romney with a few Ryan's in there. I would say MSNBC made the mistake here. Plus we have at least 5 eye witnesses who said that most people were saying Romney and that's why he corrected them.The crowd was chanting ""ryan"" before Romney corrected them.  It makes no sense for a crowd to start chanting ""romney"" upon the introduction of Ryan.I was watching the rally on C-Span ([this clip sums up precisely how I saw it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0dcXwCpBOM)), and my impression at the time was that they were chanting 'Romney', however Romney cut the chant off so quickly that it's really hard to hear who exactly they were cheering for. I only heard the whole 'crowd chanting Ryan's name' thing from MSNBC though, and did not see any other news source pick up on this oddity. Based on that rather limited information, I would rate this as True, but it's probably going to be difficult to verify.Ideally we'd have someone from the rally comment, but that wouldn't meet this subreddit's source guidelines.As much as I want the MSNBC version of things to be the case, if for nothing but the awkwardness of it all for Romney, my experience with large crowds tells me that MSNBC was looking for the Ryan chant and got close enough.  Sometimes in huge crowds you get this moment of confusion where someone will start a chant, and others will join in before they can sync up correctly.  To the people there it sounds like the nearest people are chanting correctly, but the people elsewhere in the crowd are on a different cadence.  After a few moments things sync up and no one notices the awkward couple seconds.  However, a few hours later the event makes the news and you get part of the chant in there and you realize how off base the crowd was.  When you have one person introducing another it's really easy for the chant confusion to take over, especially when you have a VP who is a very popular conservative star and he was just praised by his running mate.I would rate this false, but unverifiable would probably be the better ruling for exactly the reasons listed above.I hear both names in the clip.  Sounds to me like they were going for ""Romney, Ryan, Romney, Ryan..."" but couldn't get in sync, and Romney tried to help them along.I say that it's true that it was captioned incorrectly.e:  spellingHere is the cpsan video.  I think all the videos of this were from the same one feed, so I'm not seeing any one with distinctly better audio than the others. They all seem the same single source: http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/3985077This lady was at the rally and confirms it was Romney they were shouting. [video](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/09/28/MSNBC-Caught-Doctoring-Clip-From-Romney-Ryan-Rally)So Fox News twisted against Romney as well?http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=yj7BHEPGARQ&NR=1Good research here, everyone, but seems like no new evidence is out there other than the one feed, and various anecdotal reports from various folks at different places respective to the crowd.  Marking it as Unverifiable until more comes in if it does.You can clearly hear, ""ryan, ryan"". You're really grasping for straws when you have a canidate like [this.](http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/03/02/10563689-chronicling-mitts-mendacity)"
387,"According to [the governments own webpage](http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/#footnote2), yes sterilization is considered a form of contraceptive and must be covered by insurance.The tricky part is consent.  I can find no evidence that ACA changes the consent laws (and find it hard to believe it would as that is and has been a very clear state right).As young as 12 part is not explicit described but would be for a girl of any age once they have begun puberty (and thus menstruation).It seems like it would be mostly true.  It would be Confirmed if it simply left out the consent part.It does seem true that Obamacare does say health care plans must cover sterilization as a FDA approved method of permanent birth control. It seems we have demonstrated that it is false that only ""insurance plans held by houses of worship"" are exempt. It seems that many other regliously affiliated orgs are qualified to exempt themselves from this requirement. And the further claim in the second article that there is no parental concent and that this is somehow related to Obmacare is also false, as each State handles that issue on their own before and after Obamacare.I'm leaning to half-true. What do folks think?Ok so doing some research on this, it depends on the state. Basically if it is legal for a minor to walk into a Dr. and get sterilized without parental consent in that state if they pay in cash, then the ACA says that if insured the insurance co must pay for it.For example in California any minor may consent to medical care related to the prevention or treatment of pregnancy, this includes contraception. However it specifically states that this does NOT include sterilization or an abortion (there are other exceptions that allow abortions but they are not relevant for this). Source: http://law.onecle.com/california/family/6925.htmlBasically the ACA does not change any laws saying if a minor could legally get the sterilization. This just says that if it is legal to do it, then the insurance company must pay. This is still a states rights issue and is left up to the state to decide if a minor can legally get sterilized or not.Now back to the question. The article and the source states that in some states it would not be required, however you butchered it in asking your question. It is not every health plan by any means, it is every health plan in states that allow it.So result: The article is ""True"" however your question reguarding the article is ""False"".OK based on the research thus far, I'll mark this a ""half-true.""The ACA does mandate coverage of all FDA approved birth control, and this does include a number of forms of male and female irreversible sterilization treatments. However, the claim also is that only ""Houses of Worship"" are exempt, and this is not true. Although there is debate over if the definition is broadly defined enough or not, the existing definition does cover more religious organizations other than those set up as ""houses of worship."""
388,"The Constitution doesn't give a lot of guidance on what impeachable offenses are, it just says 'high crimes and misdemeanors', so it seems that you have to commit some act that is a crime.  (so merely being unpopular isn't enough)That rules out most of 1 except possibly 'illegally going to war', but I'd have to see details on what they think that entails.  There was some debate over the war powers act and Libya.2 is something of a problem, although I believe courts have not definitively ruled on it yet.3 needs more detail to be enough.  Unlawful warrantless wiretapping might be adequate, for instance.  Most 'police state' measures like the attacks on peaceful protesters are done by States, though.4 is ridiculous, the bill expanded health care.5 isn't a crime in any way that I can see.>Presiding over the End of the Shuttle Program & Jeopardizing Humanity's FutureReally that is impeachment material considering he had no control over that began long before he took office? Just seems like a childish and petty excuse to try to use.>and Provoking Russia Seems a bit silly considering Russia said Romney would be a mistake and that Obama was honest. Silly list is sillyPretty much everything that comes out of Larouche's mouth is false, so this goes without saying.Concerning point 2: the legal precedent set is by no means necessarily illegal.  The legality of the killing is [arguable](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/middleeast/secret-us-memo-made-legal-case-to-kill-a-citizen.html?pagewanted=all).  It is not clear that killing an American Citizen abroad is illegal.4) The ""Denial of care health bill"" is probably alluding to the board set up to approve or deny ""extreme"" measures for unhealthy people ""circling the drain"". I did read the bill in 2010, HR3590 I think, and it did set up a board which had the power to deny procedures or medications to anyone if they were likely to die anyway. But I'm trying to get the actual bill that was passed. Not sure if HR3590 was modified with Senate input before it was passed.I was going to repost this in a clearer form but i think the research here is already definitive. All seem either False or Undefinable. So I'm leaning that this be marked as False as the original question was ""are these worthy of impeachment"" legally?Do you mind if I try reposting this as:""This LarouchePAC lists a series items as Impeachable offenses committed by the Obama administration. Did these occur, and constitutionally, are these impeachable offenses?""And then we'll list them in the description.For what it's worth, if Obama ""went to war"" at all, it was illegal. Only Congress has the power to declare war, and they haven't formally done so since WWII.Congress *has* authorized Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as authorizing funding for military intervention in Libya in 2011. So that suggests that all of the relevant powers that be are pretty happy with the military actions of the last couple commanders in chief.Unless you can find Obama literally saying 'the US is at war with *X*' that claim seems pretty specious. Congress has, in some for or another, given approval to America's military engagements in the Middle East, which means Obama hasn't overextended his authority unless he has formally spoken about being at war with some foreign body.This might just be a scam to gather donations. I saw these fools in front of my local post office. First thing they did was call me, and two women (one that was raspy and creepy) and tried to scare me with pseudo-factoids, conspiracy theory  and rhetoric about the POTUS...I think, simply, these folks are phonies playing on the fear of certain pro-conspiracy people, and getting ""donations."" Larouchepac.com isn't even on Reddit officially...These ""impeachment reasons"" are just lame and ridiculous[Impeachable offenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#Impeachable_offenses) are either treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  The definition of ""other high crimes and misdemeanors is left up congress.1.  Obama has not illegally gone war or provoked China and Russia, while he has supported regime change in Egypt for example, I'm not sure how that would qualify as a high crime or misdemeanor.2. Obama has not ordered the assassination of American Citizens with or without due process.3.  Not sure what measures are being referred to.  Congress would have to decide if any measures would qualify as a high crime or misdemeanor.4.  What Denial of Care Health Bill?  This would also not qualify as an impeachable offense.5.  Simply ridiculous."
389,"The link in the graphic takes you to a lengthy report that describes the discriminatory nature of health insurance plans, such as the 'gender premium' gap. Their methodology to determine that women get charged more than men is to submit applications for three hypothetical female and three hypothetical male applicants to eHealthInsurance to see what the gap is (they also reference some data and methodologies from previous studies which I haven't gone through). That methodology doesn't sound conclusive, so while it may be plausible that when all other factors are considered women do get charged more than men for insurance, that is not conclusively true.I've seen some document releases from various Senate committees [indicating how the Affordable Care Act helps women](http://dpc.senate.gov/healthreformbill/healthbill32.pdf), but few if any from the House, so it's possible that these may be partisan. Healthcare.gov references how the ACA eliminates discriminatory practices and benefits both [women](http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/08/women.html) and [LGBT Americans](http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/01/new-options-for-lgbt-americans.html) so the Act itself definitely has provisions to end discriminatory health insurance practices.[This well-regarded ELI5 on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) points to [this page of the PPACA regarding discrimination](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66) concerning discrimination. I'm trying to find specific provisions about coverage for women, but it's a thick document."
390,"The relevant fact is that Mitt Romney has said he does not believe that waterboarding is torture. He and his campaign have made that explicitly clear. At the same time, he has evaded the question of whether he would reinstate the practice since the primaries (when the other candidates were weighing in) and simply re-stated that it's not torture.And as the original story says, an internal memo from the Romney campaign suggests rescinding it. We can't attribute that directly to Romney.Now, Obama's executive order bans torture, and Romney has made a point of repeatedly stating that waterboarding is not torture. Thanks to Romney's (probably wise) evasion of direct statements of his intent on the issue, this and the memo are the only evidence.The Washington Post summarizes it well:>Yes, it’s true that Romney has expressed support for enhanced interrogation techniques, and doesn’t believe waterboarding is torture, so it would seem that Romney is implicitly saying he would overturn the executive order. But an actual answer from Romney on whether he would revoke it would be something else entirely. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/would-mitt-romney-revoke-obamas-executive-order-banning-torture/2012/05/03/gIQARTfGzT_blog.html>Mr Romney has consistently refused to specify what interrogation techniques he would authorise as president, arguing that to do so would give unnecessary advantage to the terrorists. >However in December last year, when pushed by a reporter on whether he believed waterboarding — a form of simulated drowning — was torture, he replied: “I don’t.” http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9574724/US-Election-Mitt-Romney-aides-propose-return-of-waterboarding.htmlThis [portion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Mitt_Romney#Interrogation_techniques) of the wiki entry for this political positions seems to indicate some lack of committment to one way or the other, but Cofer Black I guess is involved in extraordinary rendition.  It very well may depend on the makeup of congress what position he would take in a hypothetical administration.Romney: “We’ll use enhanced interrogation techniques which go beyond those that are in the military handbook right now,” he said at a news conference in Charleston, S.C., in December. This was also from the Times link I listed.Doesn't that alone mean he'd advocate overturning the Executive Order that enforced strictly following the Military handbook on interrogation?So to me the direct quote advocating going beyond the military guidelines in the interrogations makes this at least ""mostly true"" that Romney has advocated overturning the 2009 Exec Order on prisoner interrogation guidelines... do folks agree?So I'm marking this as ""mostly true"" based on the quotes listed here. But I could imagine the one quote might get this to confirmed, only it does not specifically list waterboarding, but only that he supports more than the 2009 executive order on humane treatment of prisoners. So for now, a ""mostly true.""Here is the 2009 executive order in question:http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogationsThis article claims Romney advisors are encouraging a recinding of the Exec order: By contrast, Mr. Romney’s advisers have privately urged him to “rescind and replace President Obama’s executive order” and permit secret “enhanced interrogation techniques against high-value detainees that are safe, legal and effective in generating intelligence to save American lives,” according to an internal Romney campaign memorandum.  While the memo is a policy proposal drafted by Mr. Romney’s advisers in September 2011, and not a final decision by him, its detailed analysis dovetails with his rare and limited public comments about interrogation. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/us/politics/election-will-decide-future-of-interrogation-methods-for-terrorism-suspects.html?hphttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/us/politics/election-will-decide-future-of-interrogation-methods-for-terrorism-suspects.html?hp&_r=0"
391,"http://www.altergroup.com/alter-care-blog/index.php/tag/guttmacher-institute/>The Institute of Medicine counters that the “direct medical cost of unintended pregnancy in 2003 was $5 billion, with a savings from contraception that year estimated at $19.3 billion.  With nearly half of pregnancies unintended, there’s quite a bit of room to save money with free contraception.”  One estimate of the cost of birth control for women is between $3,600 and $18,000 over a lifetime, depending on insurance, the form of contraception and other factors.Before I had good health insurance, my birth control was not covered (no generic versions exist--I was using the patch at the time). By the time I got to a new job with better health insurance, I was paying over $70 a month for my birth control. (Now I pay $10 for 3 months-worth.)That's $840 a year.It's conceivable (heh) that a woman would be on birth control for at least 22 years which would hit that $18000 mark. Since the card doesn't say for how long that money is for, based on these numbers I'd have to guess it means a lifetime of BC.> Dear Mom, Mitt Romney says he would repeal the Affordable Care Act.This is true.>can I borrow $18000 for my birth control?This depends on the cost of birth control for that woman. Many women are allergic to generic drugs. There are lots of studies to confirm the $18k sum. So if you are not part of your parents insurance - you pay, so this is at worst ""half true"".I suppose over an indefinite period (say, a woman's lifetime?) someone could conceivably spend that much on birth control, but they might have to try pretty hard.Running numbers with my wife, we're spending $9 a month on the pill (Sprintec, a $9 generic at [Kroger](http://www.kroger.com/pharmacy/generics/Pages/alphabetical_drug_list.aspx)). At that rate, $18,000 would cover some 166 years of birth control. More than we're realistically expecting to need it.[This document](http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2012/02/pdf/BC_costs.pdf) factors in cost of doctor's visits and seems to think you could spend $80 per month on the pill (though I'm not sure how) putting an annual cost at nearly $1200/year. That makes the $1800 fathomable, if unlikely.But the premise of woman needing to borrow a lump sum is pretty far-fetched. I'd call this ""Mostly false.""Calculate yourself:   http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/calculator-birth-control-expensive-really-cost[edit] If you're uninsured it's right around that number depending on what method you use.Looks like they're using a PP-cited statistic for the cost on BC over lifetime:https://www.plannedparenthood.org/nassau-county/files/Nassau%20County/spring_2012.pdfIs that an accurate number?EDIT:As reseymour pointed out, Mother Jones has a calculator. To skip MJ, here's where the stats come from that power the calculator:http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2012/02/15/11054/the-high-costs-of-birth-control/EDIT 2:I wanted more sources for BC costs - they vary:http://birth-control-pills.findthebest.com/How is this ""mostly false""?>Mostly False The statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would change the reader's impression.>Mostly TrueThe original claim is accurate but needs clarification and context.How much does birth control for a woman cost? During the 30 year period of fertility up to $18,000 without insurance. That if course is just the cost purely for birth control. There are other costs women must pay for the privilege of being women.  The costs associated with birth control depend on the availability of cheaper options,  other health matters and yes even ""abstinence"". There is however no doubt that the costs associated with being a sexually active woman are much greater than that of a man. Men get viagra covered on insurance but until ""Obamacare"" women did not get birth control covered.  If the ACA is repealed, that coverage is gone. The issue on the e-card is not the $18k it is the repeal of the ACA."

393,"Dan Wallach is a [professor of computer system security at Rice University](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/).Back in the lead up of the 2004 election, him and other computer security profs analyzed the voting machine to be used in the election.You can read their findings [here](http://www.ssfcm.org/addon/content/down_load/vote.pdf), [here](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/hackavote2003tr.pdf). In 2008, Wallach testified in front the Texas house commitee of election, which you can read [here](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/texas-house-elections25june08.pdf).In sum, back in 2003, when these machine started appearing, computer security professionals judged that the computers that were about to be used to vote in the United States are laughfably insecure, ripe for abuse, and that, from their construction, if fraud did occur, it would be impossible to trace any legally binding evidence of the fraud.And indeed, since these machine have started being used, there has been many indicators of potential fraud, but no legally binding evidence of the fraud, possibly because the machines were incapable of capturing any.If you would like to get involved against the possibility of voting fraud in the future, I suggest you start following the group's work, at [http://www.verifiedvoting.org](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/article.php?list=type&type=10)--- (full disclosure, Wallach is a co-author of mine on [a robotics paper](http://gmarceau.qc.ca/papers/ladd2002robot-locate-wireless-ethernet.pdf))[This may be a good resource](http://www.iefd.org/articles/evidence_for_vote_switching.php).

If the implementation of the voting machines correlates with a sudden increase in discrepancy between exit poll results and the official vote tally, and if the increase all favors one party's candidates, this would constitute good evidence of intentional vote-switching.[deleted]I think that this claim is probably unverifiable at this point since, although there is evidence, the most that can be said is ""possibly true"" since we don't really have the ability here to prove that the suspicious factors involved were anything other than coincidental, and coincidences that look like conspiracies happen all the time.First off, no way to answer you question ""How much evidence"" since no one has all of the evidence and much is not documented. I however will try and answer this more as a ""Is there enough evidence to confirm""Result: ""Unverifiable""There is no way to truly fact check this now. Many people have tried to prove it happened, many even got some evidence, but no one got enough to prove it. It is also 8 years later and most of the evidence would have been destroyed by now.It is a theory that is backed by evidence, but there was never enough evidence to transform it from a theory to proof."
394,"I sat and made a list of claims for you guys to check:* Mitt Romney believes that with tax cuts for wealthy and fewer regulations, everyone will prosper. Doubled down on trickle down that caused crisis in first place.* Trillion in spending cut so far.He refers to his plan to compare to Romney's:http://www.barackobama.com/plans?source=OM2012_LB_YT_20120926_table_vid_desc&subsource=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=20120926_table_vid_descThe rest of the ad is essentially encapsulated concepts of his plan and they're impossible to fact check since they're future hypotheticals.The yearly budgets have increased since 2008, according to [this WAPO page](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html), here are the last few years' yearly budgets: * 2008:  $2.98 trillion * 2009:  $3.27 trillion * 2010:  $3.46 trillion * 2011: $3.60 trillion * 2012: $3.65 trillion * 2013:  $3.72 trillion (CBO estimate of Obama's budget)So Obama may be talking about ""spending cuts"" in the sense that the budget hasn't grown *faster* than it is... or he may be talking about sequestration, since it's currently law and won't be avoided until after the election... it's hard to tell. But bottom line, the red ink is growing every year, so I'd rate this one false.The issue with fact checking the ""cut spending by 1 trillion dollars"" is that we don't know exactly what he was referring to. It could be one of a few things: * The Sequestration - While completely true since it is law, it matters exactly how much is required to be cut to stop the Sequestration. If it is 1 trillion +, I would rate this as ""True"". If it is just an agreement with no required amount, I would say this is ""partially true"" since it could be overruled but as of now it is true.* He has also made other assertions to the 1 trillion dollar figure, such as with cutting the Bush tax cuts, but I cannot think of any that have taken place, only ones he has said he wants to do.Once there is some confirmation as to what he meant when he said this, it will be much easier to fact check."
395,"From the screed: ""On the political front, we learn that in the first months of his presidency President Obama appointed 43 high-priced czars a number far greater than any previous president, and not one of these professionals voted to office by taxpayers or subject to the approval of any other governmental body or official. During his current term he has also appointed 469 professionals who could be called, assistant presidents. 226 of them are paid over $100,000 a year and 77 of them paid as much as $172,000 a year.""First bullshit flag.  These Czars are government employees, not Obama attendants: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_czars_of_the_Obama_administrationHere's the book the claims are based on:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974810355/thedaical-20Oh well as long as the book looks non-biased and fair, okay. I wish I had real substantial facts to provide here but I do not. I will though ask that who ever does help out and answer this, if you could provide comparisons with Bush and Clinton at least, that'd be great. I don't think it would really track as well with farther back Presidents due to increases in technology but inflation adjustments shouldn't be huge in the last 20 years."
396,"Seems pretty false.So he invested in some foreign currencies for 5 days? That's all this is based on?Even if we ignore the short time frame, for him to be betting against the dollar, wouldn't he have to have more holdings in non-dollars than in dollars? Otherwise, he'd still be hurt by a falling dollar. Like if I bet $100 on the Cowboys winning, and then bet $10 on the Cowboys losing... would you really call that betting against the Cowboys?First, the investment was in a blind trust of sorts, so seeing as he didn't administer the trust, it's questionable as to how much direct say, if any, he had.With that said, is investing in foreign currency betting against one's own currency?  If one invests in Apple, are they betting against Microsoft?Sounds eminently unverifiable.  We're being asked to read Romney's mind (or the mind of his trust) as to his intentions in investing in certain currencies, and to accept the attack of Donna Brazile, Democratic Party  vice chair, as the neutral starting point.Very much Partisan Bias.Investing in foreign currencies (and even foreign companies) is in a very real way ""betting against the dollar"" because if the value of the dollar falls the relative value of foreign assets rise, relatively.  Economic writers call it that frequently.The thing is, though, it's not a big deal by itself.  There's nothing shady or unusual about a big fund hedging on foreign currencies for a few days.  A fairer headline would be ""Romney bets ***on*** Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, and Australian dollar"".It looks like the source got called out on it:>Update: The trades were most likely used to hedge investments exposed to exchange-rate risk, a common use of currency hedges, according to Brian Galle, a tax law professor at Boston College Law School who analyzed Romney's returns. Romney's trust manager would have offset risk on a foreign investment by also buying a position in that country's currency. Although not uncommon, the currency hedges do reflect the diversity and complexity of the Romney family's investments.Like I was saying.  Textbook partisan bias.Agreed that to fact check this we'd need to say that Romney himself knowingly did this, and that his the effect of his investment was to benefit from a less valuable dollar.I'm marking this as partisan bias.The initial term is a bit vague to begin with, but definable.Further evidence has shown that while he may have done such a thing, it's hardly extraordinary in its own. People all over have investments in other currencies, foreign companies, etc. These aren't negatives on their own. However, the use of the phrase was clearly meant to skew things against Romney as to sound negative.I'm assigning this a Partisan Bias flair."
397,"[deleted]Part of the difference is how polling was conducted then vs. how polling is conducted now. These days there is a poll of the nation, all the swing states, and several of the non-swing states, every day or two in the couple of months preceding the election.It is not the same as 30 years ago - the polling was much more infrequent and polled fewer places.Nate Silver has a bit on how effective springtime polls are: http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/what-do-springtime-polls-tell-us-about-the-general-election/He notes that 1980 was quite the outlier in the data. But to give a quick example: Say in 1980 the 'true' preference of the voters changed in a linear manner from Carter + 10 to Reagan + 10 over the 3 months before the election (this is exaggerated for effect). If you poll 3 months out and 2 months out you would see Carter +10 and Carter + 3. If you skip the 1 month poll, it looks according to the polls like Carter will do fine. But if you were to poll once a week, it would very Obviously show Carter losing the election.2012 is not like that - we have been polling weekly since February at least, and we are getting more frequent polls. It's also true that this race has been much more stable than in 1980: again from 538 - http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/the-statistical-state-of-the-presidential-race/1980 the polls jumped around a big - 2012 not so much - Obama has held a fairly steady 2-3 point lead for months. It's much more likely that this will be the true average than if it had ranged from Romney + 5 to Obama +8 and back and forth a dozen times.It was never trueHere's a table showing the 1980 pollshttp://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/3197/large/trialheats1980.png?1344537162The problem is that Reagan caught up in the polls following the debate (as far as I have read/know).Hayduke posted a great article written by CBS about this. Depending on the date/time of the poll, it was back and forth. In fact, in the run up to the election. They were polling so close that many media members were saying the election was too close to call (See link I provided in replying to hayduke's post). I saw CNN mention this exact claim not too long ago. I think the problem with this claim is that it is taking one poll that showed Carter as  having a large lead, and implying that he had the election in the bag. They did not mention other polls done at the time, or leading up to the election.[deleted]What this reeks of us a setup for massive voter fraud."

399,"Based on their own figures, the headline ought to beCitizens United ruling accounts for 78 percent of 2012 **outside group** election spending.The outside spending includes union spending, which was legal before the Citizens United decision.This is a better source for the information, for starters:http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2012/outside-groups-spending-through-roof/The information appears to add up: here are the FEC filings from 2008:http://www.fec.gov/press/press2008/2008indexp/2008iebycommittee.pdfGoing back to the Sunlight information, this paragraph is important as well:> The elimination of rules that limited the amount donors can give to outside groups only partially explains the explosion in outside spending. In 2008 outside spending may have been dampened by several factors: Obama had a stellar campaign fundraising operaton, and discouraged donors from supporting him through outside groups. On the Republican side, many of the big donors who had given to outside groups that supported the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004 election were wary of McCain’s record on campaign finance reform. And the FEC had cracked down on donors to outside groups after the excesses of the 2004 election, levying hefty fines against organizations like Swift Boat Vets and POWS for Truth and MoveOn.org, and going so far as to contact big donors like George Soros and the BellSouth Corporation, known again as AT&T.At first glance, it appears to be true.

400,"Sharing these again:* http://www.nber.org/papers/w15351 questions whether inequality is being compared properly.* http://www.voxeu.org/article/china-and-cheap-imports-champions-equality the role of cheap imports in keeping inequality low.* http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=4049 As the inequality argument hinges on stagnant wages, this study posits that wages have not stagnated, but has been rising. More here: http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=1140* http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/faculty/web-pages/Inequality60s.pdf This is now a dead link, but the meat:> “In general, accounting for taxes considerably reduces the rise in income inequality since 1963, while accounting for noncash benefits has only a small effect on changes in income inequality. Consumption inequality is less pronounced than income inequality, particularly for the bottom half of the distribution. Both income and consumption inequality rise in the early 1980s and remain somewhat flat in the 1990s, but in the 2000s overall consumption inequality shows little change while overall income inequality rises somewhat.”I'm not sure if we can prove outright bias in the presentation regarding inequality in either direction, but the idea of income inequality is one of consistently incomplete information.To really answer this question, we have to consider breaking the abstract into two parts.  Part 1: >""There is a considerable amount of evidence that inequality is not a steady state and that it tends to rise and fall with the business cycle. Income inequality today, for example, is no worse today than it was during the Clinton administration.As strange as it sounds this appears to be mostly true based on this study: http://www.cfr.org/united-states/income-inequality-debate/p29052Ignore the 1%'s income rate (which fluxuates wildly) and look at the three lighter blue lines.  For most of the 30 years this study covers that is a true statement.  Income rates rose between Clinton's term and 2007 at about the same rate.  If you average in the 1% with the next highest bracket it becomes a different story, however.  The income of the 1% is the curve destroyer in a lot of senses.  In the 2002 numbers it makes it looks like the incomes of the top 20 percent of the country took a massive hit and rose by huge numbers in the 2005-2007 period when it was only a small portion of the population.  However; this is only a percentage change in income, not the actual percentage of national income earned by the percentiles of the country for that: >From 1968 to 2010, the share of national income earned by the top 20 percent rose from 42.6 to 50.2 percent, with gains concentrated at the very top. Meanwhile, the ""middle class,"" the middle 60 percent, saw its share decline from 53.2 to 46.5 percent. So over the last 40 or so years we've seen an actual increase in the percentage of income brough home by the top earners, while the 60 percent not in the top and not at the bottom *lost* a percentage of the national income.  For this part of the abstract it seems they are right by one measure, that income inequality is fairly equal over long periods of time, but wong in the assumption that it is no worse than under the Clinton Administration, as our numbers show that it isn't the case when you consider the top 20 percent instead of the top 1 percent and top 19 percent.On the second half of the abstract: >""Moreover, whatever gains have been made by the top 1% of Americans have not come at the expense of those in the bottom 99%. In fact, the incomes of the 99% are actually much higher than they were two decades ago.""We've already seen the quote that will easily refute this one: >From 1968 to 2010, the share of national income earned by the top 20 percent rose from 42.6 to 50.2 percent, with gains concentrated at the very top. Meanwhile, the ""middle class,"" the middle 60 percent, saw its share decline from 53.2 to 46.5 percent. I would suggest that the study in question is making a false dichotomy here, possibly even trying to make a completley misleading point.  Saying that income has increased for the middle class is fair, pointing out that it happened continiously even as the top earners saw income skyrocket is correct.  By looking at raw income numbers those conclusions are totally logical, however, there are two really bad flaws here.I would make the case that 1% is never an appropriate sample size when talking about income inequality.  As we saw in the chart, the 1%'s income fluxuates as other incomes increase steadily.  Saying that the 1%'s earnings haven't stopped someone else from getting a wage increase means about as much as me saying ""more cats than dogs were adopted this year, and that didn't stop the average wage from going up!""  The two have almost nothing to do with each other.  However, when comparing the top 20% to the rest of the country we see the drop in percentage of overall income earned by the percentiles.  This suggests that the top earners have increased their wages so fast and so high that the middle class is being left in the dust.  The second half of this abstract relies on cherry picking a small percentage (1%) and then making a near pointless statment (everyone's wages increased) while ignoring the fact that the top 20% increased their income at such a rate that the middle class, while earning higher wages than they were a few years ago, have less of the national income as a percentage.It's very well sourced. The article isn't saying that the rich pay too much of the tax burden, it's explaining that the success of the top 1% does not have an adverse impact on the rest of the country (the 99%).  [Here's the graph](http://i.imgur.com/d8dyZ.png)  ""The data shows that the gains of the top 1% don’t come at the expense of the “middle class.” Between 1987 and 2009, the overall incomes of the bottom 50% grew by 41%, middle income Americans by 43%, and upper middle income Americans by 55%. At no time did the rise in incomes at the top result in a decline in income for middle income taxpayers. On the contrary, the peak years for the top 1% were also the peak years for everyone else.""One can easily infer bias from their list of current and past Directors:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_FoundationNote the appointees from ExxonMobil, Americans for Prosperity/Koch Enterprises and the five directly Republican-affiliated ones.Also, a quick visit to their website has a large graphic (part of a slideshow) stating that ""2 in 5 filers pay **NO** income tax"".Below is Paul Krugman's response to the article posted above. I'm inclined to believe his intereptation of the numbers more than a the Tax Foundationhttp://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/zombie-straw-men/And a second link to Krugman on changes in total income share 79 to 2007http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/inequality-trends-in-one-picture/Both of these links would suggest the study, and the statement are false."
401,"It may be a bit tangential, but we recently had a former congressional aide on /r/Politics discuss how there is always too much paperwork to be signed, so politicians regularly allow their employees to forge signatures on documents. So even if we could demonstrate a human being physically signed these documents, we would still have no way of knowing if the president was signing them.As to other president's doing the same: my grandfather's honorable discharge was signed by president Truman. Considering an estimated 16 million Americans were serving in WWII, I think it's safe to assume that Truman wasn't spending his days signing all of those letters.[On NPR's Storycorps](http://castroller.com/Podcasts/NprStorycorpsPodcast/2340060) a bomb disposal expert talked about losing his wife (also a bomb disposal expert) when she went on a mission, and how he would receive condolence letters that started with ""Mrs. Voelz, we're sorry for the loss of your husband"". This isn't specific to Obama (the guy simply refers to high ranking government officials) not does it say anything about electric pens, but it seems to support the view that there is some automation going on in generating these letters.From some cursory Googling here's what I came up with:Initial story:http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/08/obama-honored-fallen-seals-by-sending-their-parents-a-form-letter-signed-by-electric-pen/The White House denies this:http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/white-house-disputes-charge-president-uses-auto-pen-for-letters-to-lost-soldiers-grieving-families/This guy did a handwriting analysis based on the pictures posted by GWP:http://speakwithauthority-jsm.blogspot.com/2012/08/electric-pengate-probably-not.htmlHe states that an electric pen was not likely used.As to your second question, the ABC story says this has happened before:*""The White House did not dispute that the letters were form letters, but that would appear to not be unique to this president. A 2003 Newsweek story reported that the sympathy letters grieving families had received from President George W. Bush were “form letters. With the exception of the salutation and a reference to the fallen soldier in the text, the letters the families shared with me are all the same.”*  However, WaTimes says Bush sent personal letters:http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/22/bush-cheney-comforted-troops-privately/?page=all#ixzz24xKdewEIShould give you all a place to start.Donald Rumsfeld was also accused of sending condolence letters signed by autopen.[removed]"
402,"Aren't terms like Social welfare and Corporate welfare a bit abstract in how they're defined?It seems to me you can make the numbers say whatever you want with how you define the terms.A complete, brazen falsehood or lie.http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/newsgraphics/2011/0119-budget/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2013-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2013-BUD.pdfAs you can see, on page 69 of the PDF, the ~~food stamp~~ Department of Agriculture's food programs (+ food stamps) cost over $100 billion per year, despite the ""study"" claiming otherwise. On page 114 of the PDF, you can see Medicaid is nearly $300 billion.That's **$400 billion** on just two programs. You'd have to do some major mental gymnastics to not define Medicaid as social welfare. And then you have state-level social welfare programs. Is primary and secondary education defined as social welfare? The ""study"" also claims farm and other subsidies are corporate welfare. Well, that may be so, but these subsidies also keep prices of commodities down to some degree. So, if subsidies make food cheaper, is that social welfare too? The claim made by this ""study"" is a very easy **false**."
403,"Living paycheck to paycheck is the definition of spending 100% of your earnings back into the (local) economy.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consumehttp://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/Stimulus-Impact-2008.pdfI tried to paste in the table but rolled a 1 and critically failed.The short version is that for every dollar spent in the stimulus on food stamps, 1.73 dollars was added to the economy; for every dollar of Bush tax cuts, 0.29 dollars was added to the economy. There are lots of others in between, but those are the two extremes.I am not sure this is a factual question. There is indeed much statistical and historical evidence relevant to it. But proper interpretation of that evidence turns on some highly controversial economic theory (e.g., monetarism, Keynesianism). This is well beyond the ""did Obama really propose X?"" variety of fact, which can be verified by consulting the public record.Common sense says ""true"", but this really isn't verifiable.Poor people don't have access to methods of spending money that *don't* invest it back into the local economy. Rich people do in the form of tax havens, financial structures, and offshore investments.I can't think of a single way to spend money that doesn't invest it back into the economy that doesn't involve shipping it overseas somehow - an option the poor just don't have.To class this as ""unverifiable"" is to dismiss 100+ years of economic theory.  For the GOP on this site, that will include Hayek and Friedman.In the effort to stimulate the economy, we're just trying to get money to exchange hands more, i.e. customers to businesses to employees, repeat. While higher income people do tend to invest tax-cut money, many of those investments don't really add economic value (e.g. real estate, the stock market). However, given the Marginal Propensity to Consumer, low income families would directly spend their money with businesses, increase sales, create the need for more employees.IMHO, it seems this direct focus on ""creating jobs"" is to put the cart before the horse. Companies are laying people off because sales are down, and they're not going to hire until sales increase. If we add to the customer spending pool, this would increase sales and create the need for more employees.All money is ""in the economy"" unless it is buried in the ground or hidden in a mattress.   And even that is sort of in the economy because if provides a value to the owner in a sense of safety that allows him to spend future earnings.So no, all money pretty much stays in the economy, no matter what, and, in free markets, will find itself to the highest valued uses.You're dealing entirely with likelihoods, which is dangerous.  You're first premise is ""...the poor are far more likely to invest money they get back into the economy...""  The basis for this premise is that poor people are forced, by virtue of being poor, to spend this money.  Your second premise is ""someone who is rich is more likely to let a tax cut sit in a bank account...""  Now, what is the basis for this premise? I'll go ahead and assume (I have heard this case made before) the argument, but correct me if I'm wrong.  The basis for this premise is that rich people didn't get rich spending all their money. They most likely got rich saving it in a bank.  Accepting these premises, the conclusion is that poor people help the economy because they spend their money, while rich people don't spend their money.  The problem is that a) money in banks doesn't just sit there, b) what evidence do you have that rich people spend money overseas more than domestically? c) how is the benefit to the overall economy of money invested in a hedge fund necessarily less than the benefit of an item purchased? d) rich people spend money too. They didn't get rich hiding cash in their basement.For the person who marked this as unverifiable.A simple guide to economics.http://tutor2u.net/economics/revision-notes/as-macro-consumer-spending-and-saving.htmlI am unsure of what you are asking as the ""poor"" could reinvest with a tax cut.  As most ""poor"" don't pay federal income tax at the end of the year the only taxes you could seemingly cut would be Social Security and Medicare (both of which would be disastrous).I should note that I define ""poor"" as the bottom third of income earners.Because of government investments in welfare and education, my siblings and I were given the same opportunities as every other child growing up. Because my single mother didn't have to worry about where we would get our next meal or how to pay for a hospital visit if one of us got sick or injured, she was able to spend more of her time/energy on preparing us to be responsible and educated adults. Now, my older sister has her associates and my brother and I are currently attending a four-year university. To me, taking care of someone's basic needs and giving them an education which leads to a high-paying job sounds like it would stimulate the economy more than a perpetually impoverished family."

As for a starting point. [The Tax Policy Center did a paper on the Base Broadening Income Tax Reform](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1001628-Base-Broadening-Tax-Reform.pdf) according to his plan. Here is also a [FAQ from TPC of that paper as a way to help clarify the findings](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1001631-FAQ-Romney-plan.pdf)It's important to note that they wrote those papers based off the available information he has given about his tax plan. Without all of the details, they had to rely on assumptions for certain parts. That should be a good starting point for this claim.Romney, on his [recent 60 Minutes interview,](http://www.examiner.com/article/on-60-minutes-romney-gives-some-specifics-but-they-contradict) said that he would lower taxes across the board by 20%, while at the same time closing certain tax loopholes. In this way, Romney, argued, he could lower taxes AND take in as much revenue as before.When given the chance to offer specifics, Romney was able to account for $200 billion in cost reduction of his proposed $500 million in revenue loss from his plans.A similar plan (cutting 20% of taxes across the board) was [examined in April](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/how-romneys-tax-plan-could-raise-middle-class-taxes/) by the ""centrist Tax Policy Center,"" with help from economists from the last two presidencies. This plan, IF it were to remain revenue-neutral, was determined to ""raise taxes on 95% of Americans,"" all families earning less than $200,000 per year, and would raise their taxes by an AVERAGE of $500. [Here is a link to the analysis:](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/how-romneys-tax-plan-could-raise-middle-class-taxes/), which seems to tell a different story than the ABC story, namely because it doesn't bring into account keeping the budget revenue-neutral. This is to say, taking the analysis at face value would assume a non revenue-neutral tax cut, and would increase the deficit.The very highest levels of income earners benefit most according to the analysis... but nowhere here or anywhere else do I see an analysis claiming that ANY income level would pay $2000 or more per year in taxes under any of Romney's proposed plans.The $2000 claim comes from [an Obama ad](The Obama ad relies on a study by the Tax Policy Center that tried to explore ways that Romney’s plan could be paid for, with one hypothetical scenario suggesting taxes on middle-income could go up $2,000.) which uses the same analysis, but focuses on ONE hypothetical situation in which taxes were raised $2000 on middle class families in order to fund tax cuts for the upper income earners.This SINGLE scenario, under which middle class familiar would pay $2000 more per year in taxes, was examined by [Politifact Virginia,](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/article/2012/sep/17/ad-watch-look-obamas-attacks-romneys-tax-and-medic/) which repeated that it was a possibility.The bottom line: the $2000 claim was originally made by the Tax Policy Institute as a possibility, and the Romney campaign has yet to release enough details about what SPECIFICALLY they would do to disprove it outright.This should be ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True,"" as it's plausible, and Romney has yet to release the details to dispute it in anything besides rhetoric.Relevant http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/24/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-could-take-away-middle-class-tax/"
406,"The $450B refers to the American Jobs Act, which failed and then had some subsections reintroduced as separate bills to get additional votes (the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act; Rebuild America Jobs Act).It's hard to tell from his wording whether he meant ""each of the votes would raise taxes $450B"" or ""together they would raise taxes $450B"". It's (essentially) the latter.The AJA raises taxes $450B (the ""your taxes"" applies only if you make over $1,000,000). It omits a relatively important qualifier (time frame: it's $450B over 10 years), but it is based off of the non partisan [CBO](http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/186307-cbo-obama-jobs-bill-reduces-budget-deficit) score of the American Jobs Act:> The Senate Democrats' bill, which replaces Obama’s taxes on the upper middle class with a 5.6 percent surtax on those with annual incomes above $1 million, raises $453 billion over ten years and reduces deficits by $6 billion. The tax kicks in in 2013. He's definitely in the true end of the spectrum. If he was speaking from prepared remarks, I'd place him somewhere above ""mostly true"" due to the omission of time frame and the ambiguity of ""your taxes"" given the targeted nature of the hikes. Speaking extemporaneously and with a time limit, I'd just go true.Can this one be confirmed as mostly false yet?>The statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would change the reader's impression.Vote 160/11American Jobs Act of 2011http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00160Tax cutA bill to provide tax relief for American workers and businesses, to put workers back on the job while rebuilding and modernizing America, and to provide pathways back to work for Americans looking for jobs.Vote 177 2011Expenditurehttp://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00177The Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act provides $35 billion to create or protect nearly 400,000 education jobs, while preventing the layoffs of thousands of police and firefighters.Vote 195 2011http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00195ExpenditureRebuild America Jobs Act$10 billion to National Infrastructure Bank$50 billion for expenditure on roads and bridgesTax increase 0.7% surcharge on those making more than $1million per annum. So unless a 0.7% tax increase on incomes above $1 million raises $450 billion then the statement is false.Leaving out the 10-yr time frame *and* the condition that it only affects income above $1million is a significant omission and creates a false image of the truth.I don't believe we can mark something as true if the purpose is to misrepresent the facts. Massachusetts median income by the 2010 survey is $63.9K (Page 5 here: http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acsbr11-02.pdf)Mean household income, by fifths and top5.http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2011/H03AR_2011.xlsThe top5 percent are listed at $311k - just how many are going to be affected by a surtax that only affects income above $1m? This is why again I would suggest creating a new category that says ""missing critical information and context."" When Brown says $450B tax raise **and it's not going to affect 95% of households in Massachusetts**, it is difficult to say that this is true or even 'mostly true.'If you make 1m+? Yes it's true.If you're part of the 95%? No it's not true."
407,"She may not have done anything that required her to have a law license in Massachusetts.  This is not as clear cut as it may seem.  She helped on some cases.  She may have even practiced under her Texas or, more recently, New Jersey license.  I see a lot of accusations but no specific instance of a violation.[Here's an attorney's take on the matter from the comments:](http://www.wiestlaw.com/)> I would agree that Prof. Warren’s lack of candor about the scope of her consulting work is fair game. Whether it’s prosecutable unauthorized practice is by no means obvious.> If the work in question was confined to consulting with admitted counsel (e.g., attorneys for asbestos insurers), as long as Prof. Warren did not file a sole appearance for a client, nor provide services to “laypersons”, she would likely be within the safe harbor of ABA Model Rule 5.5 (c)(1), as adopted in the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Responsibility (permitting non-Massachusetts lawyers to provide “legal” services “undertaken in association with a lawyer who is admitted to practice in this jurisdiction and who actively participates in the matter”.) Furthermore, _if_ Professor Warren’s work were limited to consultative services in the form of providing or guiding research and writing for trial/appellate/amici counsel, it would be little different from that of a “law student intern” permitted to assist an admitted attorney under ABA Model Rule 5.3, Comment [1], as adopted in Massachusetts.> IIRC, the scope of the activities of Haavaad law professors as more or less permanent consultants to one or several law firms (notwithstanding Harvard’s prohibition of its law faculty holding “of counsel” positions on law firm letterhead) has always been a source of bemusement/irritation to people inside and outside the Law School. If (for whatever reason), Professor Warren had ceased to be a member of any state bar, she should have received credit for her assistance to counsel of record by footnote (as customary for “nonlawyers”), rather than through “of counsel” credit on the cover of the brief (I doubt she would care as long as the checks cleared). I would hope that the limited resources I contribute to the Massachusetts bar disciplinary system would be directed to more serious threats to the public than this.> Two other points:> 1. I was once a member of the New Jersey Bar before I moved to Massachusetts. I finally resigned as of 2011 when I got fed up with contributing to the clients’ security fund of a jurisdiction in which I never set foot on my own. If Professor Warren did the same, I can’t blame her.> 2. Whatever the benefit of continuing education may be to practicing lawyers, mandatory CLE rules do more to assist those who provide CLE than anyone else. Massachusetts is one of the shrinking numbers of jurisdictions that do not require CLE (I am exempt in New York only because my sole office is in Massachusetts). In my view (and it appears I may be in agreement with Professor Warren), this is a feature, not a bug.> Again, to the extent Professor Warren was happy to sell her talents to assist the 1%, it’s fair game to state she’s part of the problems of crony capitalism that _both_ the Tea Party and Occupy abhor. The question of whether such conduct constitutes unauthorized practice may be of intellectual interest in Cambridge, but, in relative terms, is merely a sideshow.I'm not a lawyer. Hopefully we could find one to help us here. As for point #2 on that article. It looks like they are showing her name use in the Amicus Curiae briefs. Which are ""Friend of the Court briefs"" You can find information (how well explained they are is unknown) on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae), [Free Legal Dictionary](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Amicus+brief), and the [California Labor & Employment blog has a great write up](http://www.lcwlegal.com/82609) As far as I understand it, the Amicus Curiae brief can be filed by any third party (It doesn't mean the court has to admit it) who is a non-party of the case, who wishes the Court to consider information or an argument when ruling on the case. From everything I've read, these briefs are usually filed by lawyers, but I can't find a requirement where it *has* to be a lawyer.I cross posted this to /r/law. I hope someone over there who is more familiar with the law then I am, can come help shed some light on this.As much as I want this to be the case, I don't think this is an issue.  She was legitimate in New Jersey, and these are federal cases which wouldn't, in theory, care about whether she was legitimate in Massachusetts as well.If these were Massachusetts cases specifically, there may be something to it.  As it stands, though...Two lawyers wrote into *National Review* with this take: http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/328356/elizabeth-warren-unlicensed-lawyerThe question is ""in legal trouble"". No Court has or is challenging her, so there is no ""trouble""."
408,"Not true, and it's explained [in the top comment:](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10bqqy/9_million_is_missing_from_romneys_2011_return/c6c3jaf)> Estimated payments are not based on an actual estimate, they are based on the prior year's income. This is an IRS requirement. You can guess at your income and pay less, but if you're wrong and underpay, there are large penalties.> Contrary to what they state, it's almost impossible to actually know what the income will be in advance on a large and diverse investment portfolio. This is a 50 page return summarizing thousands of pages of investment details. Yes, $9 million is a lot of money to most individuals, but it's not a lot in the context of a $250 million portfolio.> The whole ""conspiracy"" is based on the fact that the accountants estimated the tax due based on the prior year, as is required by the IRS.Sometimes the comments are very useful! In fact, most of what's good in reddit come from the comments, and/or things are explained like this.I'm going to concur with false. It's true that the Romney and the accountants overestimated his 2012 income, but that's neither noteworthy nor unusual. There's no money ""missing"" because that money was never there. There's also just a lot of innuendo in the linked article: > His 2011 taxes were $1.94 million, and if those taxes were on the income that he said in January was his 2011 income, his actual tax rate was closer to 8.54%. That's junk. It's an estimate based upon a guess and a ridiculous hypothetical."
409,"Initially it appears true...[Income Taxes by Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates[Here's an analysis](http://taxfoundation.org/article/oecd-corporate-income-tax-rates-1981-2012) by the non-partisan research group Tax Foundation that shows combined state and federal taxes above the OECD average.**But** then there's what we call the *effective* corporate tax rate. There's a study of Congressional Budget Office records -- [Wall Street Journal paywall](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204662204577199492233215330.html) or [here's a Time article that explains it](http://business.time.com/2012/02/06/the-corporate-tax-rate-is-at-its-lowest-in-decades-is-big-business-paying-its-fair-share/). It found that the effective corporate tax rate is **12.1%**, the lowest it's been in 40 years. The study was conducted by the Wall Street Journal, obviously not a publication that's hostile to business (it happens to be owned by Rupert Murdoch, if that's any guide).Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner [advocated lowering corporate taxes](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/02/16/Geithner-Cut-US-corporate-tax-rates/UPI-77721297846800/) in 2011.**TL;DR** The effective corporate tax rate, the rate that was actually being paid in 2010-2011, is 12.1% according to a WSJ study of Congressional Budget Office records.On the surface, yes. [Here is a Canadian study conducted on corporate tax rates comparing itself to the rest of the world on Table 2](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://policyschool.ucalgary.ca/sites/default/files/research/83countryreport.pdf&chrome=true&pli=1)Heritage.org, a conservative think tank, [distilled the same numbers into a graph here.](http://www.heritage.org/federalbudget/corporate-tax-rate)The CATO institute, the libertarian think tank, released that the US is the 4th highest in the world; [followed by Argentina, Chad, and Uzbekistan](http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb_65.pdf)CNN, the mildly left-leaning news corporation that you may have heard about, [says the same thing.](http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/27/pf/taxes/corporate-taxes/index.htm)All of these sub-sources are citing one organization though, [The OECD](http://www.oecd.org/) ([Excel documents showing their numbers here](http://www.oecd.org/tax/taxpolicyanalysis/oecdtaxdatabase.htm#C_CorporateCaptial)). However, I cannot tell if there is any sort of bias or error here. If there is, it doesn't have to do with American politics as the OECD is Parisian.However, the OECD's data [does appear consistent with what is happening in the world.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444230504577615232602107536.html) Corporations do not just get up and leave a nation that has a low corporate tax rate.If this is a verified, it has to be with a big asterisk.  The effective tax rate is one of the lowest.Obviously the US corporate tax system favors large companies that design their business around tax shelters and write-offs and hire lots of accountants to catalog and itemize numerous deductions.  Meanwhile, smaller businesses end up paying higher rates because they can't take advantage of all the write-offs and deductions.[Here's a graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_effective_corp_tax_rate_1947-2012.png) showing the decline of the effective US corporate tax rate since the 1940s.The reason the effective rate is so different from the nominal rate is because of [tax shelters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_shelter), [tax havens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven) and other loopholes. This makes it so that not all the actual income is taxable. The 39% corporate tax rate only applies to a certain part of the income. This is the type of thing Mitt Romney has been [accused of](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444025204577546884190037366.html) doing in his personal finances.

411,"A professor at the University of Minnesota actually spent some time with this last year: http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2011/02/selection_bias_politifact_rate.php> A Smart Politics content analysis of more than 500 PolitiFact stories from January 2010 through January 2011 finds that current and former Republican officeholders have been assigned substantially harsher grades by the news organization than their Democratic counterparts.> In total, 74 of the 98 statements by political figures judged ""false"" or ""pants on fire"" over the last 13 months were given to Republicans, or 76 percent, compared to just 22 statements for Democrats (22 percent).He's accusing them of a selection bias for sure, unless one truly finds it believable that Republicans lie at a significantly larger rate than Democrats.I think the first step would be to create a dataset of all (or as many as possible) of the fact-checking services out there.  Then politifact could be tested against the mean.    I've been looking for a pet project to distract myself with, and this sounds like a good one.  I'll start working on it.OP will deliver, but it'll probably take a few days.  I'll let you know what I find.Can't really answer your question but if you want some data to compare I have done an evaluation based on their data:http://therealityprose.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/honesty_in_politics/Basically I compiled all their reviews (minus ones like chain letters) and found the averages. If you wan't the raw data I can give that to you also. The data on that page is a year old but it would be easy to update it (which I plan to do soon anyway)From what I see, it does seem that Republicans tend to be more vocal and controversial. I think there is a bias but it isn't liberal. The bias is towards controversy. They don't really fact check things that don't stand out. Then again, it would be impossible to fact check everything, you have to make a decision what is worth fact checking and what isn't. They will definitely fact check something that is all over the media but probably wont check something that is just said on the house floor during a normal session. So perhaps you are right that Democrat's lies are more boring. That could mean that they are more harmless also, or they just lie about things people can't relate too as well.This would seem to be to be an unverifiable opinion question at the end of the day.Looking at their ""Who is PolitiFact? Who pays for Politifact?"" from 2011: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/blog/2011/oct/06/who-pays-for-politifact/""Since 2010, we have partnered with other news organizations that operate PolitiFact sites in the states. Most of these partners are newspapers such as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Austin American-Statesman (both part of the Cox chain) and the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Star-Ledger of Newark and the Oregonian (all part of the Advance chain). We have one radio partner, New Hampshire Public Radio.""Cox tends to be conservative, however they own some liberal news as well.Advance Publications (Interesting side fact, they own reddit Inc) tends to actually not take a political side at all. They own both Magazines as well well Newspapers that have a bias to both sides.""We accepted underwriting for our PolitiFact Florida project from foundations that seek to improve news coverage or civic discourse. We received money from the Knight Foundation, Craigslist Charitable Fund, and the Collins Center for Public Policy.""Knight Foundation - Non Partisan, they believe in fact checkingCraigslist Charitable Fund - Non Partisan from what I found however there is not a lot documented about themCollins Center for Public Policy - Non Partisan: ""In 1988, after retiring to Tallahassee, Collins and a group of distinguished Floridians started the Collins Center for Public Policy to seek out creative, nonpartisan solutions to Florida’s toughest issues.""""We are an independent, nonpartisan news organization. We are not beholden to any government, political party or corporate interest. We are proud to be able to say that we are independent journalists.""They say they are non partisan.Reviewing many of their articles it really does not look like they pull any punches for either side. They call out lies no matter who says them.I think this keeps coming around because the GOP took a major step towards the Tea Party in the last 4-6 years and the Tea Party tends to say what they believe happened or their interpretation and never back it up with facts. The GOP rather than fact checking themselves is having it said and then arguing that the fact checkers hate them. Politifact has become the leading group doing the checking and therefor rather than dealing with what is being said has found it more advantageous to attack those pointing out the faults.I think there is also less coming out of the liberal basis over all because they are the incumbents. The arguments they tend to have are theoretical in nature because it is policy that is not in place and this makes fact checking much harder unless the argument is that report/group said this about that particular policy. To argue something that has not happened and what you think will happen is much harder to fact check then saying that person X caused Y to happen.There is no way to actually confirm this.    Their choice of what to confirm could be the biggest bias of all, and would radically affect their results.There was one lately where they checked a Romney joke, and said it wasn't true, even though it was obviously meant as a joke.   So technically they were correct: the joke wasn't true.   Does that make it a lie?   Or just humorous political rhetoric?    And do they check all of Obama's jokes about Romney?[MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Explodes: ""PolitiFact, You're Fired!""](http://youtu.be/a44sP22bDqY)> Obviously this argument is silly but one could argue that they purposely pick and choose what they fact check to make Republicans look bad. That's exactly the point.  They can purposely pick and choose what they fact check to make Republicans look bad.Just like this sub reddit can up vote questions and comments that make Republicans look bad and down vote questions and comments that make Democrats look bad.The adjective is ""Democratic"". Using ""Democrat"" as the adjective is a product of Republican pollsters finding that it polled worse as the adjective and then advising the Republican apparatus to start using it every time. Insidious, and relevant to this question because it is a subtle indicator of bias, complicated by the fact that it was so subtle that even many in the media started saying it without realizing its origin.Id say no.  Theres a whole section called ""Obamameter"" just verifying everything he says.Will there ever come a time when conservatives simply 'man up' and accept that factual discourse is not a matter of political bias? I think the most galling aspect to these overwrought claims of systemic bias is the underlying postmodernist presumption inherent in the claim that all media is based on 'competing narrative' and thus fact based analysis can be viewed through a Lyotardian lens of situationalist knowledge. As if who is the presenter - the storyteller - changes the underlying basis in fact of a statement. And then there's the appeal to victimhood built into the claim. As if, by some great media conspiracy - the firms of whom happen to be consolidated into no more than a handful of corporate parent owners who are largely conservative themselves - conservatives viewpoints have been somehow wrested from the stage of political ideas. To be censored. Muzzled. Smothered out of existence. Yet this faux perceived victimhood is just the opposite of conservative self-image making. The Marlboro man, standing upright and hitching his horse, ready for a ride toJohn Galt's hideaway, self made and independent, powerful and capable. The thought of his ever being a victim, whining on about media bias - as if he cared whether people _believed him_ - is anathema to the self image. And yet, here we have conservatives who at every turn of contradictory news whine on about media bias as the cause. Never once looking inward. Never considering that, perhaps, the facts are as they wish them not to be. On the one hand, for the conservative media strategist, this is simply a game of working the refs in the area of journalism. But for the conservatives who buy into these conflicting values, it represents a dangerous self-delusion that drives conservatives ever further away from testing belief against physical reality. One need only contrast the conservative belief in a grand conspiracy of climate scientists working with liberals to destroy industrial society, against the scientists' actual findings. Or the belief that the teaching of evolution is somehow a grand conspiracy of atheists out to destroy a traditional religious values, to be believed word for word as written in the bible. Is that left wing bias? Or is it conservative ideology, strayed so far from demonstratable physical reality that its adherents can not be seriously termed rational? Man up. Assert your positions. Make your case. But stop whining about bias when others don't buy your conclusions. Otherwise, you become that stifling force you claim others to be. And then, wrapped in that communal bubble of comforting self delusion, your only means of doubt becomes not challenging your own perceptions in order to test them, but looking outward for a scapegoat to blame in order to make disappear whatever thoughts and ideas discomfort you. For that's what these claims of 'liberal bias' have become. Simply another way to shout out thoughts you wish did not exist.Yes.  It's mainly in what facts they decide to check.  They'll try and find anything one side says, and dig deep for reasons to write an article showing inconsistencies.  For the other side, they'll ignore heaps of lies and misstatements."
412,"So here's the problem with The Independent's article. The subtitle to the headline is, ""Exclusive: America 'was warned of embassy attack but did nothing'"" but this quote isn't found in the body of the article. What is found is this:>According to senior diplomatic sources, the US State Department had credible information 48 hours before mobs charged the consulate in Benghazi, and the embassy in Cairo, that American missions may be targeted, but no warnings were given for diplomats to go on high alert and “lockdown”, under which movement is severely restricted.So the fact that's inspiring these headlines appears to be that there was knowledge of a non-specific threat that embassies in the region may be targeted. The original source of this story **does not claim that there was specific or actionable information** about Benghazi or Libya. Other articles that are claiming the US government had information on the embassy attack and did not act are deliberate distortions of the truth, as they use the Independent as a source, but attribute claims that the Independent never made.Some of the other sources we have here are use The Independent as reference.The [WSJ](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444165804578008411144721162.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories) article, which the Washington Post cites as ""ample evidence that the administration screwed up"" only says that security was heightened in Egypt but not in Libya in advance of the attack. No mention of a warning specific to Libya or the Embassy.This whole story is looking more and more like a house of cards. Unless some other source for this claim is revealed, I would say this claim is false.Edit: NewAccts has pointed out that the attack occurred at the US consulate in Benghazi, whereas the US embassy in Libya is located in Tripoli.Just to help maybe clarify this. The American Embassy in Libya is in Tripoli. What was attacked was a US consulate in Benghazi. The [About.com - Geography](http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/embassy.htm) has a fairly good write up of the differences between a consulate and an embassy. Some people might say it is nitpicking, I think it helps clarify especially when taken into consideration of the sources of the claims and the information they have. I think we're looking for information whether the US government had any specific information about the Benghazi attack. *The Jerusalem Post* I see no information about information of attacks on the Benghazi consulate, just claims about attacks on the US and Israeli embassies in Egypt. *WSJ*It seems this article also fails to mention any specific information about these attacks, but it does imply that the government *should* have realized that there was a threat (but again, with no information about that specific attack)>Alarm bells about security in Benghazi started sounding this spring.>On April 10, someone threw an explosive device at a convoy carrying United Nations envoy Ian Martin. On May 22, a rocket-propelled grenade hit offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.>After the June 6 IED attack on the U.S. consulate, the U.S. asked Libya to step up security around American installations, said a State Department spokesman. Libyan officials say the request was only for one week. A State Department official said the temporary security buildup was needed to repair damage to the wall.>Tensions remained high, however. On June 11, a rocket-propelled grenade hit a convoy in Benghazi carrying Britain's ambassador to Libya, injuring two bodyguards. Britain closed its consulate in Benghazi.>As the attacks mounted in Benghazi, intelligence agencies warned of the growing security risks, **but didn't have specific intelligence about particular threats or planned attacks**. On Aug. 27, the State Department issued a travel warning for Libya, **citing a threat of assassinations and car bombings in both Benghazi and Tripoli**. The warning said the embassy's ability to intervene was limited because armed groups behind the attacks were ""neither sanctioned nor controlled by the Libyan government.""I think what would be important is if the intelligence indicated any attacks on the Benghazi consulate, or if it was a wide spread threat of attack for US Diplomatic missions in all of Libya. But the odds of us getting our hands on actualy US Intelligence to find that out is slim. >Ethan Chorin, an American development economist working with U.S. and Libyan officials on a hospital in Benghazi, said he spoke by phone to Mr. Stevens about an hour before the assault, and the ambassador told him there was ""no indication of trouble"" following the protests in Egypt. Mr. Chorin said a subsequent conversation he had with the ambassador's security officer was cut short by what the officer said was a serious problem. Several minutes later, he could hear explosions from his hotel room across town as the assault began.*The Washington Post article*I think this is a reliable source since they support the article with the actual comments made by government officials, but we should omit the biased passages. Firstly, they link to the WSJ article which I already covered. The rest of it seems to be finger pointing, which a National Security reporter's quotes to support its claim and the lack of answering a State Department Spokesperson. *The Independent UK*I agree with [HaunterGatherer's post about that article](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/10asxd/is_it_true_that_obama_administration_had_some/c6bv1lc)*Commentary Magazine* They cite the Independent article mentioned above. There isn't much else to this article other than backing up what the Independent said.I think the prevailing opinion is that the attacks were planned, I think most of us would agree. But the claim as to whether the administration had intelligence about it.The key word in the title here is ""suggesting"" which further widens the parameters for this claim. Personally, I don't know if there is enough information available to the public to really make any definitive decision. But the evidence of the other threats, causing elevated threat levels maybe be argued to be suggestive intelligence. If nothing else is disclosed, I think this may come down to opinion.Thanks as we check this can you help us quantify ""some"" evidence? Just want to keep this from being a back and forth as what qualifies as ""some"" (any?) and also how specific the ""evidence"" should be we are checking if it existed...want to be sure we are vetting the exact question you want checked. Would ""did the Obama admin have specific and actionable intelligence of the attacks before they occurred?"" Cover it? Or if not let us know what would...Can you provide a link or instance of someone making this accusation? That might make it easier to track down the source, since I'm not finding anything in my news feed about this.**Here's some sources for the claim:**[The Independent UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/revealed-inside-story-of-us-envoys-assassination-8135797.html) - This appears to be the origin of the claim.[Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444165804578008411144721162.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories)[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-embassy-cover-story-dissolves/2012/09/21/ab61bb1c-03fc-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html)[Commentary Magazine](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/09/14/did-u-s-know-about-embassy-attack-threat-in-advance/)If the threat you are asking us to check on includes ""not actionable"" info not sure how the second part of your ask makes sense in seeing if the admin ""didn't act on it."" But it sounds like regardless the clarified ask is if the admin had evidence not if general danger but of this specific attack prior to it. Did I get that part right?The best thing I can think of is what [Rachel Maddow reported](http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-rachel-maddow-show/49027233) after the attacks. I am not sure it claims the administration had any knowledge of the upcoming attacks, but it definitely points toward evidence that the attack was not simply provoked by the video, rather it had been planned for some time.I think it is also relevant to consider how much evidence of danger from elsewhere existed. Hypothetical: If I found a video on youtube of some terrorist announcing the attack days before it happened, that evidence would pretty damning. On the other hand, if there were 20 or 100 videos announcing attacks on the same day, it's possible they didn't know which were credible and which were not. I think people often forget that looking at a situation in reverse doesn't always demonstrate incompetence.  This is all purely hypothetical speculation, but I definitely think it's possible for interpretation of evidence to be bias in this fashion.This article form the WSJ indicated no warnings other than the usual 911 heightened security, right up to the attack, and and that on the 10th intelligence warnings were sent (not ignored) to Cairo and they took measures to send people home there:>In the days before Sept. 11, intelligence agencies issued their annual warning of heightened security risks around the anniversary of the 2001 attacks....>In Libya, embassy personnel conducted a security review right before the anniversary. It determined there was no reason to think an attack was planned or the consulate in Benghazi was ""insufficiently postured,"" said a senior administration official.>On Monday, Sept. 10, intelligence agencies sent a warning directly to the U.S. embassy in Cairo saying the protests could turn violent. Diplomatic security officers in Cairo sent most embassy personnel home.>Intelligence analysts at the time had no reason to believe the unrest would spill over to neighboring Libya or beyond, officials said. State Department officials likewise found no reason to put other embassies in the region on heightened alert and decided not to call in Marine teams to help in Cairo....>Ethan Chorin, an American development economist working with U.S. and Libyan officials on a hospital in Benghazi, said he spoke by phone to Mr. Stevens about an hour before the assault, and the ambassador told him there was ""no indication of trouble"" following the protests in Egypt. Mr. Chorin said a subsequent conversation he had with the ambassador's security officer was cut short by what the officer said was a serious problem. Several minutes later, he could hear explosions from his hotel room across town as the assault began.>During a final call by Mr. Chorin to a security officer at the consulate, the attack began, and his call was cut off.http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444165804578008411144721162.html?mod=googlenews_wsjAs we look at the timing of the protests versus the mortar attacks, this seems useful to know:>Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said it was ""clearly a terrorist attack,"" but mortars weren't used until six, seven hours into the fight.>""So it seemed like an armed gang that seized an opportunity,"" Smith said.http://www.abc6.com/story/19598949/obama-extremists-used-video-as-excuse-to-attack"
413,"The 112th Congress isn't finished yet.   They have to come back into session after the election to pass a few more bills.It's true that just [151 bills have become law](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-08-14/unproductive-congress-not-passing-bills/57060096/1) to date in 2011 and 2012, which is fewer bills than any Congress since 1945 and 1946.It's an opinion that passing bills is productive.  Some of us like a Congress that doesn't pass bills.Number of laws isn't a great way to measure production, because some laws may be small and some laws may be huge in impact.This is one that is hard to measure. As gglebanc mentions below, some believe that a congress that doesn't do anything is a better congress that passes legislation. On other metrics they are pretty unproductive:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/13/13-reasons-why-this-is-the-worst-congress-ever/This is going to come off as partisan, but the crux is, Republicans decided at the start of Obama's term that the best way to get back into power was refuse to hand him any victories. This was a pretty historic change, where typically a minority party looked to work on areas of interest with the majority party, ie Bush II and education reform.  There's a reason why they're called the minority and not the opposition, like in a parliamentary system.  This is a big reason for the title of least productive congress in Modern History. Keeping the status quo doesn't necessarily help the conservative/tea party movement either, nothing has been done on social security or Medicare, nothing has been done on the Fed, why - because nothing has been on democratic priorities either."
414,"I remember from my History studies the most basic way of assessing the validity of any source is to ask of it,Who, What, Where, When and Why.What kind of source is it, (statistics etc.), Who created it (very important), where was it produced (red state, blue state etc.), When was it created (Is it an old source, if so, is it relevant now(, and most importantly, why was it originally created. The reason for a source's creation may not be the same as the reason its being used now.If you are looking at statistics created by a health authority for example, was it created to request extra funding? If so, maybe it has been exaggerated.We also use here (and thus really like) Wikipedia's policies on reliable sourcing. They have done great work and we're happy to stand on shoulders of giants and all that.Their definition of reliable sources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOURCES#Reliable_sourcesAnd their definition of a nuetral point of view:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOVOther good clues to a post or article or claim is using only snippets of an opponent's statements (the smaller the fragment and the more the use of ellipsis, the more suspect to me), not sourcing their claims. etc. seems like some good advice here: http://newstrust.net/guides/crap-detection-101I think all sources are biased, because you have to choose or not include certain data at each point.There are very few things that are as easy as, say, US Population, where there is a pretty much agreed-upon source for that (within the limits of their methodology).   Most data the best you can do is find someone who has a different point of view and use your brain.No matter what source you use, someone somewhere will say it is biased.I don't see ever proving a source as non-partisan being completely possible. The only way to deal with it is to have them list the reasons they believe it is partisan and then fact check those beliefs. Most of the time when they say it is partisan the reason is because they heard it from source X. If the believe source X over you, you can never convince them otherwise no matter how many facts you have to back it up.If I find something that leans left or right, I'll check it against some respected media outlets on the other side of the spectrum. Often the WSJ might (quietly) corroborate something that supports a Democratic claim or MSNBC might (quietly) corroborate something that supports a Republican claim.And of course you can check things against Reuters, AP, government reports. The bias of the initial source is irrelevant if you can verify the claim with multiple reliable sources. What matters is the veracity of the facts presented, so you can avoid depending on any one source.There are studies that found that your own strong personal attitudes on an issue change your own perception of bias. [Here's one of them](http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/etd/id/3712/rec/17). Whatever process you develop to determine whether something is bias will be denied by people with strong opinions. Even the perfect neutral unbiased piece of journalism will be seen as ""biased partisan bullcrap"" by those individuals. [One interesting study](http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/6/0/8/7/p60870_index.html) actually found that even the source by itself can make someone believe it is biased. For example, if a conservative reads something labeled as produced by MSNBC, they write it off as biased, even though it was actually published by Fox News. So, determining bias is a subjective issue and you must understand that whatever method you come up with will not be accepted by all.> Is there any good way that we can all agree on to determine that a source isn't guilty of bias or false equivalency?As soon as a source moves into opinion from the facts, they are biased.  Pretty much every source today is biased.  And, as a group, we're never going to agree on the bias.When we agree with the opinions, we tend to go ""what bias?""When we disagree with the opinions, it depends on how we react.  We can react intellectually, and go ""that's an interesting opinion"".  We can react emotionally, and go ""there go those extreme right wingers again"".  ;-)If we're here doing this, most of us should be able to know the difference between reputable sources (AP, Reuters, NYT) and nonreputable (Alternet, ThinkProgress, WorldNetDaily, etc).  It's obviously going to be case by case.""A biased source is whatever doesn't agree with me"" - redditorsA pretty obvious way is to check the ads on a source. If someone links to a source that is advertising any candidate, it's biased. Elementary, I know, but it's surprising how often this is overlooked."
415,"Here is the first souce, a magazine for a free-market think tank who did a feature on Ryan in 2010:> With his father’s passing, young Paul collected Social Security benefits until age 18, which he put away for college.[http://www.wpri.org/WIInterest/Vol19No2/Schneider19.2.html](http://www.wpri.org/WIInterest/Vol19No2/Schneider19.2.html)This claim is TRUE.http://www.wpri.org/WIInterest/Vol19No2/Schneider19.2.htmlhttp://www.rollcall.com/news/rep_paul_ryan_politics_in_america_profile-216813-1.htmlhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/us/politics/family-faith-and-politics-describe-life-of-paul-ryan.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.wwwI would rate this as true.This actually appears true, but for the wrong reasons that Alternet wants to make you think:http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79592.html> 9.

417,"But here is this from CNN fact check on the history of Cloture votes in the Senate, checking the ask: ""You had to cast more votes to break filibusters last year than in the entire 1950s and '60s combined.""If we are using cloture votes as a key metric and assuming this research is correct, doesn't this answer the question?--------------------– A vote to end filibuster debate is called a cloture vote. From the 81st Congress (1949-1950) through the 91st Congress (1969-1970), there were a total of 30 votes on cloture. There were no more than seven cloture votes in any single session during those years.– Starting with the 92nd Congress (1971-72), cloture votes became more frequent. Part of that can be explained by the fact that the Senate changed the required majority in 1975, making it easier to induce cloture.– The 110th Congress (2007-2008) is the record-holder so far: There were 112 votes on cloture during that two-year period.– So far, the 11th Congress (2009-2010) has held 41 cloture votes, 39 of them last year, two more this year.Bottom Line: President Obama is correct. There were 39 cloture votes last year, nine more than the combined total for 1949-1970.http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/02/03/cnn-fact-check-senate-cloture-votes/OP presents some good information.Now, if I'm reading this correctly, the contention made by the points presented by the OP is that Senate Dems used cloture to end debate on legislation prior to filibusters being enacted.So while one can point to Senate Republicans as filibustering a record number of times, one can also interpret the data to say that Republicans never had a chance to filibuster, as Senate Democrats ended debate before filibustering could occur.So now what we need, if I understand this correctly, is to drill down further. We need data for each bill that was debated and whether a filibuster occurred prior to cloture or not. We'd also need similar data for prior years to decide whether Republicans did indeed filibuster more often or not.Further, cloture was not enacted every time it was voted on. Therefore we need to look at what happened after cloture was voted on and turned down. Did a filibuster occur? It's a lot of data but that seems to be the best way to go about it. OP, is my understanding of this accurate?How exactly are we defining ""using the fillibuster?""  Does a threat to use one count? Here is where more specific terms would help us fact check more precisely.This is true:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-history-of-the-filibuster-in-one-graph/2012/05/15/gIQAVHf0RU_blog.htmlThe current culture in the Senate, since the Democrats have come into the Majority, has for the minority to require 60 votes for any thing to proceed.  The question could also be asked: ""Are Republicans causing an unprecedented level of obstruction in the US Senate"" And the answer is yes.The problem with this graph is we have no way to know how many times a filibuster is actually used because bills now come with an automatic filibuster filter.  The senate wont bring a bill to the floor if they don't think they have 60 votes.  Also, there is never any official filibuster but a senator simply has to say ""I would invoke the filibuster"" and the bill gets scrapped.  This is unverifiable at best simply because in a backroom meeting someone can say ""this will get filibustered"" and then it gets reworked until it meets the ""super majority"".Read [this](http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/21/opinion/zelizer-congress-polarization/index.html). I don't have time to explain it but perhaps the [United States Senate's own website](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/cloture_motions/clotureCounts.htm) will shed some light on the topic.One more bit of evidence of the history of Cloture votes. Here is this chart listing the number of cloture votes since 1919:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-history-of-the-filibuster-in-one-graph/2012/05/15/gIQAVHf0RU_blog.html"

419,"Thanks for the edit. It's much easier to discuss specific quotes rather than more vague generalities.> ""For two years he had complete, unadulterated control of the federal government, a 60-seat majority in the Senate, an 80-plus seat majority in the House. That's demonstrably false. As I mentioned elsewhere, Democrats had 58 members plus two independents in their caucus for approximately seven months, between Al Franken's swearing in on July 7, 2009 and Scott Brown's swearing in February 4, 2010. You also have the medical leave for both Kennedy and Byrd affecting the total number of available votes and the timeframe.> He got every -- literally every piece of legislation he wanted, to try and, quote, turn around the economy….The most simple example of this not happening is the [list](http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/07/stimulus.cuts/index.html) of items cut from the stimulus in favor of tax breaks.Edit: I'd flair this ""mostly false"" based on the sidebar criteria. There are elements of truth (there was a point when Democrats had 60 votes and the House), but it contains incorrect information (time frame) and leaves out important context (health leave for Kennedy/Byrd, modern use of the filibuster).Obama had 60 votes in the senate for about 14 weeks. And those 60 votes included Lieberman, an independent and multiple right wing democrats that enjoyed holding up legislation to extract the concessions they needed. This type of quote is often presented about the stimulus, job creation bills or Obamacare. But when the stimulus was being passed he had to convince republicans, including the ladies from Maine to support the measure (which meant directing more to Maine and reducing the overall spending by about 100Million).And it was very important for Obama to have Republican support. Republicans understood this and knew that by refusing Republican support the general public would read his actions as very partisan, the exact opposite of the platform he ran on.  This was a major reason why the general public (those that don't follow politics closely) opposed Obama care was the highly partisan nature of the debate. http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/chris-wallace-obama-had-filibuster-proof-senate-majorityI think we have defined that as Sarals ask here -- the one more edited for clarity is did Obama have ""complete, unadulterated control"" of Congress. Some of the conversation here was from his earlier ask that was using the less precise ask did he simply have ""control.""Our goal here is to fact check the questioner's true question, and Sarals has made that precise question clearer with the edited more full ask. And the answer I see the is that this is False. ""Complete, unadulterated control"" of Congress would have required Democrats to hold beyond a slim Super-majority, enough for Obama and allies to loose decent fringes of his Party base and still ensure that their agenda would be enacted. As it was we have shown well that had strong influence, but far from ""complete unadulterated control."" Evidence that this was not true would also include the ""Cap and Trade bill"" that was a central part of the Obama campaign that passed the House but stalled in the Senate. ""Complete and Unadulterated control"" that allowed for ""literally every piece of legislation he wanted"" to pass would have certainly included that. The larger debate here over the precise definition of the word ""control of Congress"" -- and the precise power a President really has over co-equal branches of Government even when they are his own party -- while it brought up some good research, history (and a lot of argument) was not relevant to the actual questioners true ask. And the goal here is to fact check and answer real people's real questions. So we are doing that here, and I'm marking the full question from Sarals as False.So I guess, now that the fact checking is done, we can mark r/politicalfactchecking as yet another subreddit that moans and groans its way to skewing everything left.  It's ok reddit, there really wasn't ever much hope for you.FWIW - I've never seen any source stating the minutia of ""control"" as has been done here.  Simply put, Obama didn't have the support of his own party.  So no, he didn't control them.  Never in the history of politics has control referred to marionette strings or chicken-blood joo joo about actually controlling other people.  It is universally understood (except on reddit) that if a president's party holds a majority in the house and senate, that said president likely has control of what is legislated.  Unless you suck at presidenting and your party knows that supporting your legislation will kill their reelection hopes.[Yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses)2009-2011: Senate was was 58 Dems to 40 Republicans, and two independents that caucused with the Democrats.   House was 257 to 178 in favor of Democrats.The Senate numbers vary for various reasons, but they still had a large majority in both houses.How the hell is this listed 'False'? First, OP asks if Obama has control of congress, and in every meaningful or historic use of the word, he did.Then OP changes the question to one extreme, exaggerated use of the idea that is clearly false, so that the title mismatches the edited question.   And so now the title question is listed as false, when it is clearly true?WTF?    Either change the title, or mark this true, because if someone looks through this sub and sees that title and False next to it, they are getting inaccurate information.Hmmm...I think that this one really should be marked half true/half false if anything.The headline implies something a bit different than the edit does.  At first glance, it doesn't look too good for anyone coming to this new sub-reddit looking for non-partisanship.Edit: Added half/false in addition to half/true since it could go either way.I can't believe the top rated comment in this thread is going to verify this as false.  That will completely destroy the point of this subreddit, and completely mislead anyone coming here for non-partisan answers.  The congress is composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate.What political party member held the seat of [Speaker of the House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi) from 2009-2011?What political party member held the position of [Senate Majority Leader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid) from 2009-present?The question in context is referring to whether or not Obama, a Democrat, had fellow Democrats as a majority in congress.  Don't break the question down into semantics until it suits your political preferences."
420,"Of course, like all economic analysis, there are many factors at play.Just to help you, and other posters get a starting point.

From what I can see, I think this might be a case where correlation is not causation ~~I think it is important to note that the GDP grew from:~~~~While during the 20's it went from:~~The Income tax rate on the highest brackets during 1918 was 77%.Rate in 1919 was 73% Reduced to 58% in 1922Reduced to 46% in 1924 Reduced to 25% in 1925Raised to 63% in 1932. During the period where our highest tax brackets paid 90% of income in Federal Income tax: Years 1944-1963. Our GDP grew from:1944 - $219.8 Billion to  1954 - $$380.4 Billion  1954 - $380.4 Billion to  1964 - $663.6 Billion If you use Cato's reasoning, then economic growth should have been absolutely stifled since Income tax rates were almost double what they were in the mid 1920's. Which leads me to the conclusion that Cato's article is most likely a gross oversimplification of what happened during the 1920's. To me, it seems like the article is just a political point about taxes, wrapped in misinformed and simplified explanation of how our economy functioned in that time period. I think their conclusion supports what I'm saying. >The tax cuts of the 1920s were the first federal experiment with supply-side income tax rate cuts. Data for the period show an initial decline in federal revenues as tax rates were cut, but revenues grew strongly during the subsequent economic expansion. After the cuts, total tax payments and the share of total taxes paid by the top income earners soared. President Bush's current proposal to make phased-in rate cuts effective immediately also promises to expand the tax base. Indeed, Congress should consider further rate cuts to stimulate even larger gains in incomes and economic growth.An endorsement of President Bush's tax policies through a narrow minded view of historical economic data, which is almost irrelevant as our economies operated very differently bewteen the 1920s and 2003 (when this article was published)They do remember what happened in [October of 1929](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929), correct? I mean, I would never point at the 20s as a time to model your economic policy after.I think the problem with the article is that any single experiment in economics is inconclusive, because there are too many interacting factors.    You'd need to look at 100 years of history.I tried this one, and except for the years 1943-1947 or so, the result was obvious.   The question is whether throwing out those years invalidates the data, or was that really an exceptional time?You can do similar studies worldwide, comparing long term growth rates to long-term size of government."

I only talked to the mod who removed the threadThis original claim was removed by another mod. Which I completely stand behind. I have nothing but mutual respect for the other mods and stand behind all of their decisions. The original post was an unsourced claim. Your thread contains a starting point from reliable sources with images to view. So I understand why this thread is allowed and the other one wasn't. >JUST as legit as asking if Obama wore shoes with holes in them 30 years ago, which I protested against, but was allowed.It seems you didn't exactly [protest against it being fact checked](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/zj2h0/rush_limbaugh_on_ms_obamas_speech_why_were_obamas/c650wp9), but that you made the claim that it was impossible to verify. Which ultimately was untrue, as we had multiple biographical accounts that corroborated the claim. Before the claim was supported, I agree wholeheartedly that it was unverifiable. Which is where I stand with this thread. I don't think it is verifiable. The only reason your thread is allowed is because it is closer within the guidelines than the previous thread was. If Boggart took the time to look around the threads and the sidebar, I believe his thread wouldn't have been removed if he had a starting point as you do, or if he linked to a site that was making the claim. We'll give this thread time to accumulate posts and look over what is posted. As for now, the nature of it makes it unverifiable. We'll assign it that flair, and if any information is posted that can verify it, we'll change the flair accordingly. Hope this clears this issue up for you guys.My guess is that he probably asked for some extra spray on tan, or he got a fair amount of sun somewhere this week, maybe from a tanning booth.  The skin seems lighter around his eyes, possibly from sun glasses or those protective glasses you wear in a tanning booth.  His make-up also looks particularly muddy.But that is pure speculation, and unless someone comes forth with a video of Mitt asking to look more Mexican, then this one surely will be unverifiable.This may sound a little off - but maybe the makeup girl at Univision didn't have anything lighter??? He did look a little more ""Ricardo Montalban"" than normal...I expected Hervé Villechaize to pop up any second and go ""Boss! The Plan! The Plan!""So...what's next for Mitty?

423,"True, for the most part.

The national average is 9%.This doesn't answer the question, but we know that [46m](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34SNAPmonthly.htm) out of 311 million people use food stamps, 15%. So we're looking for 11% to be in the program less than 12 months, and 4% in for less than 12 months.4/11 = 36%So we need 36% of the people enrolled in the program to be in it more than 12 months. This is where the USDA report comes in really handy, because on the same page we have the percentages of people enrolled for a full 12 months, for each state. They average out to about 38%. So for 2010, about 4% of the US population had received a full year's worth of payments, and these past few years have been had the highest enrollment in the past 30 years.TL;DR All signs point to **true**.The argument here is that Americans are not ""moochers"" but the argument is not what we are vetting, we are vetting this fact claim: ""did less than 4% of US population receive a full year's worth of payments like foodstamps over the last 30 years?""[deleted]Any other research here?

425,"All the links lead to Examiner.com to articles all written by the same guy. After reading his articles, he's essentially looking at each poll's polling percentages for Dem. vs Rep. and adjusting the points to 50/50. He also appears to correlate every poll back to Rasmussen, using it as the baseline. As far as I can tell though, none of this follows any proper statistical modeling.He calculates the percentage vote for each candidate by a) finding the percentage of Democrats, Republicans, and independents who would vote for Obama/Romney, and b) multiplying each figure by the [Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/partisan_trends)'s measure of the partisan population to determine the final vote. e.g. if a poll shows 90% of Democrats, 2% of Republicans, and 50% independents voting for Obama, then he'll do (0.9 * 0.33)+(0.02 * 0.36)+(0.5 * 0.29) = 44.9% of the popular vote for Obama. This heavily assumes that 36% of the general population would vote Republican, 33% of the general population votes Democrat, etc. Even the Rasmussen poll which the calculations are based on show the figures varying pretty widely over the course of a few months - and their numbers do not correspond with[ Gallup's estimates](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx) for party affiliation. My statistics is a little hazy, but I'm also quite sure that you can't just unskew a poll by recalculating averages like the Examiner contributor did; if it were that simple, the pollster organizations would have applied those fixes before reporting their results.

I've seen two polls go as high as D+12(fantasy).There is reason to believe that the 2012 election is going to be somewhere between D+0 and D+4.  Republicans are motivated to turn Obama out, while Democrats are not as excited about voting for Obama or against Romney.  The Obama campaign strategy has been to get his voters to come out and vote against Romney.The author of the graphic in question is assuming D+0, which is in the realm of probable.  There may be some other methodological flaws in his analysis.The main purpose of the graph is to cheer up Romney supporters in the face of negative Romney reporting by the liberal leaning media."
426,"The conclusion of this article comes from a study published by The National Bureau of Economic Research [This is the paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18396) which can be purchased. Without purchasing, they do link to their data processing that has data from 1774-1860 found [here](http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/tables.htm). From 1860 and beyond, we should be able to fund data sources for relevant information to fill out missing info and put the whole point into context.Not going to comment on true or false, but if there is some truth to it, it must make you think about whether inequality is intrinsically good or bad.Context matters.Some studies and articles regarding income inequality:* http://www.nber.org/papers/w15351 questions whether inequality is being compared properly.* http://www.voxeu.org/article/china-and-cheap-imports-champions-equality the role of cheap imports in keeping inequality low.* http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=4049 As the inequality argument hinges on stagnant wages, this study posits that wages have *not* stagnated, but has been rising.  More here: http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=1140* http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/faculty/web-pages/Inequality60s.pdf  This is now a dead link, but the meat:> “In general, accounting for taxes considerably reduces the rise in income inequality since 1963, while accounting for noncash benefits has only a small effect on changes in income inequality. Consumption inequality is less pronounced than income inequality, particularly for the bottom half of the distribution. Both income and consumption inequality rise in the early 1980s and remain somewhat flat in the 1990s, but in the 2000s overall consumption inequality shows little change while overall income inequality rises somewhat.”The conventional wisdom regarding income inequality may not be as honest as many want it to be.I had some disagreements about this, based on what I read on the issue earlier. Namely, income inequality is typically measured in quintiles (or fifths of the population). This means that the botton 20% could have a much smaller percentage of income today than in 1774, and yet the bottom 1% could be much better off. My family has always been in the bottom few percent, but there's no way the bottom 1% today is as bad as the bottom 1% then -- because the bottom 1% then literally had no wealth, being slaves.tl;dr: It depends on the level of granularity that you are examining income inequality on.I'm going to vote mostly false because the USA didn't exist in 1774I cannot see this being true.  Though thinking about it, population being massively less may factor in here."
428,"It would be useful if there was a tracker for how this money was spent in each state, such as if the money taken from the federal government was used for infrastructure construction/maintenance or incentivizing businesses to invest by giving leniency in taxation or social services.  Unsure if that granular of detail is available, though.The NY Times compiled [this interactive map (The Geography of Government Benefits)](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/12/us/entitlement-map.html?ref=us) which lays out the distribution of benefits across the US for an article in February: [Even Critics of Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html?pagewanted=1&_r=moc.semityn.www). They cite the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and I am digging a little deeper to see if I can find anything that directly tackles Federal income vs spending on a state by state basis.Let's give this a go.First, a breakdown of federal taxes collected and federal spending by state from [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union) from 1990 to 2009.Next, [population density by state.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population_density)And then [a breakdown of the states by rural population.](http://www.dailyyonder.com/how-rural-are-states/2012/04/02/3847)  The average amongst the states is 28.5% rural, 71.5% urban.On the first link, we should eliminate Puerto Rico, as it's not a state and as such is in a unique position.  Note that it is heavily urban.Of the ten states that are top net recipients of federal cash, Maryland, Virginia and to a lesser extent West Virginia (about 10% of all West Virginians are employed by the Federal Government according to the Office of Personnel Management - http://www.opm.gov/feddata) are home to a lot of Federal Government workers due to their proximity to Washington, D.C.The other seven are Alaska, Maine, North Dakota, Alabama, Montana, MIssissippi and New Mexico.  They are all heavily rural.  Only Maine and New Mexico could be considered blue states.Now, let's take the top ten net donors: Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Nebraska, Massachusetts.  Of these, New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts are some of the most heavily urban states in the Union (all above 80%).  Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio and Michigan are middle of the pack.  Nebraska is the only red state and the most rural. So let's look for outliers.  Blue Vermont is the most rural nation in the state at 82.6%, but is only 17th highest recipient, one place below Arizona, an urban red state.  Red Wyoming is the second most rural, but the 18th highest recipient. Texas is an urban red state - 13th highest net donor, 75% urban.  Wisconsin is 12th highest net donor, purply-blue and only 56% urban.  Indecisive Florida is one of the least urban states but is a net recipient (near the middle of the states).  Red Georgia is about average in terms of urban/rural and is right behind Texas in the net donors list.  Utah is highly urban but is middle of the pack, a small net recipient.So what's the answer?  I don't know.  There seems to be a tendency towards urban to rural transfer, and urban states generally being more blue than red, but there are enough exceptions to make any correlations pretty weak.  I'm not a statistician, and I'm at work so I won't go into this anymore, but here's a bunch of facts.  Enjoy.http://democraticactionteam.org/redstatesocialism/index.htmlhttp://taxfoundation.org:81/article/federal-spending-received-dollar-taxes-paid-state-2005This does seem true to a point, but it's largely the wrong conclusion to draw.  This will probably be the first and last time I rely on Mother Jones for anything, but...: http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/11/states-federal-taxes-spending-charts-maps> This red-blue split may be partly explained by the difference between urban and rural states. Red states are more likely to be rural, and rural states were more likely to receive more federal spending than they paid in taxes in 2010. Among predominantly rural states, 81 percent received more federal spending than they paid in taxes. In contrast, 44 percent of urban states received more federal spending than they paid in taxes.The issue, at least according to the graphs, is less red/blue and more urban/rural.  An issue as well is the definition of red/blue states using the 2008 election model, which greatly increased the number of blue states in a pattern that didn't hold in 2010.  I'd like to see these numbers updated with a clearer picture of where states more traditionally sit in the spectrum as opposed to where they sat in a unique election year.A big part of the problem is that states are not homogeneous lumps.It's certainly true that in aggregate many of these red states (which are often composed of 40%+ democrats by the way) recieve more in benefits than they pay in federal taxes.This doesn't really paint a very informative picture though.It's not like they divide the federal spending by the population and cut everyone a check. Some individuals benefit vastly more than they pay, and some individuals pay vastly more than they recieve regardless of what the aggregate percentage is.Let's look at this another way: The states receiving the most ""benefits"" from the government dislike them so much that they want to reduce them.The blue states are stopping this from happening."

However, the increase happened before the ""most restrictive"" law took effect.Not sure we found more evidence beyond what ggleblanc did, but that looks convincing.

It stems from an investigative report from WSBTV Channel 2 from Atlanta You can find their [article on this, here](http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/mosque-makeovers-with-your-tax-dollars/nD9db/)What the patdollar article seems to do, is assign blame to President Obama for this, which is misleading.

YesThe repairs stem from the State Department's program known as the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation, which is a component of the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. It is basically a grant program, that was created to preserve cultural sites around the world in an effort to benefit diplomacy. It was created by Congress in the early 2000s, it is noted as being Public Law: 106-553 with a search of that leading to the Library of Congress [H.R. 4942](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d106:7:./temp/~bdqgBC:@@@R) the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001.Which was signed into law by President Clinton on December 21st, 2000It has contributed funds to repair Islamic Mosques, Christian Churches, and a whole variety of cultural sites around the world. They have a public database, and interactive map on the website to view their projects.[Which you can find here](http://exchanges.state.gov/heritage/afcp.html?utm_source=Wikipedia&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=AFCP%2Bon%2BWikipedia%2B-%2BOngoning)The relevance of what is repaired and who is President is debatable at best. To quote Fact Check.org>When we searched the State Department’s database and lists of 2009 and 2010 projects for ""mosque"" and ""minaret,"" we found that 30 mosques or minaret restoration projects had received funding under Bush, and seven such sites had been funded under Obama. Also, 29 projects for churches and cathedrals were funded under Bush and 13 under Obama. Those totals do not represent all Christian or Islamic historical and cultural sites, however — our search for ""mosque,"" for instance wouldn’t pull up funding for an Islamic monument or conservation of ancient manuscripts, and our search for ""church"" didn’t pull up restoration of convents or monasteries.Whether or not the President has a say of what sites get prioritized, I personally have no idea. Since it was created by Congress, and appropriations are approved by Congress, the only ""blame"" for the creation of this bill could be put on Bill Clinton as he signed it into law, and on CongressAgain. I would rate this half true. Mosques were repaid with Federal money, but the patdollard site implies that blame should be on President Obama and completely omits any mentions of other sites that were repaired by the program. Which is thoroughly disingenuousSo to be clear the fact to be checked is: ""Does the US fund via Foriegn aid, the programs listed in this Action 2 news investigation, and if so does this article fairly describe the scope of the work done?"""
431,"Technically true, but it discounts size of the economy and size of the debt.  It just looks at non-adjusted dollars with no economic context.  It also ignores non-Obama related expenditures like interest on previous borrowing and unavoidable war costs like Iraq.  Most importantly, every dollar spent in the US budget has to be approved by congress, so blaming a president for a budget is a little like blaming Larry because the 3 stooges aren't funny.  I mean, it's partially Larry's fault, but most of it was Moe's idea.I could just as easily cherry-pick that the national debt almost doubled under GWB (5.7tn to 10.6tn), while only rising about 35% under Obama making Obama the most frugal president since Clinton. While true, that's a little misleading as well - we are in a deficit spending condition right now due to the enormity of the recession.  Congress is spending like crazy - I wouldn't call them particularly ""frugal"".Also, the numbers are far more favorable towards Obama if you discount the first year of each's presidency as leftover policies from their predecessor.  If you consider the period 2002-2010 as the GWB policy period and 2010-2012 as the Obama policy period, what you see is that the GWB policies raised the debt from 5.9tn to 12.3tn (108%).  The Obama policies raised the debt from 12.3tn to 16tn.  (about 30%).  Again:  misleading cherry picked numbers, but it makes Obama look like Ron Paul.My point is not that Obama is a better steward of our national debt than GWB.  My point is that this headline is equally as misleading as ""OBAMA SLOWS RUNAWAY NATIONAL DEBT"".  Unfortunately, the nuances of targeted deficit spending and monetary policy can't be condensed into a soundbite headline designed to get the attention of very stupid people.

(Versus costs to the deficit through policies that were in place prior to his tenure, such as the cost of the Iraq war, etc.)  Or does it count simply the increase in the deficit during the days of his being President?I could be very wrong here but isn't most of the debt coming from interest now? If they're saying that it's Obama's fault that the interest of the debt is stacking up then I don't think that's accurate. I'm sorry I don't have the time to research this at the moment but that sounds like another way to blame Obama for everything wrong with the economy.The numbers work out, but is GDP specifically ""adding to the economy?""  That would be my question - I honestly don't know.If you could add $1 to GDP permanently by spending $3 once, you would be a fool not to. In fact, this is exactly what Republicans claim to be accomplishing by cutting taxes: losing revenue (accumulating debt) to grow the economy.Anyone have numbers on how much is from increase in spending vs loss of tax revenue from the economic collapse?What do folks think here? I think at best half-true.This has to be labelled FALSE because it implies a casual relationship -- that for every dollar of the economic stimulus policies, we have to pay back $3 which is WRONG. So a ""mostly true"" isn't correct by journalism standards. If you want to say the outstanding National Debt went from $10.6 trill in '09 to $16.0 trill in '12, that is definitely true.[removed]"

They were saving for potentially becoming married, and they work at these huge factories.”That is definitely owning a company that created jobs in China...  That's Romney himself speaking.

Several of the companies mentioned in the article grew into major international players in the offshoring field today.The Atlantic Wire: http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/07/know-your-obama-and-romney-outsourcing-claims/54440/With one exception on the Atlantic Wire, they note that the outsourcing activity that is being alleged happened after Romney left Bain in 1999, rightfully absolving him of responsibility.  The one exception: > Fact: Romney was in charge of Bain the entire time it owned Holson Burnes, from 1987 to 1995, FactCheck.org explains. Yes, according to SEC filings, Holson Burnes outsourced most of its photo frames, but the same filings also show 75 percent of its photo albums were made in New Hampshire. The fact-checker says it doesn't know if outsourcing actually increased under Bain. As for the South Carolina plant, its closure did not mean the immediate opening of a Chinese one, because the company closed that line of business, which sold to pro photographers. It did open a foreign plant to do another line of business, the fact checker says: ""after the South Carolina plant closed, Holson Burnes entered a joint venture with Chu Kwun Kee Metal Manufactory, Ltd. in mid-1994 to manufacture picture frames."" Looks to be a false charge, still.I'd say this is true. ([link](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/us/politics/as-romney-repeats-trade-message-bain-maintains-china-ties.html?pagewanted=all)). Note- Obama also has invested in one of the companies named."
433,"And this from the Atlantic:""Romney's statements are a little unclear, but it appears that the 47 percent figure represents all of those who pay no income tax, rather than the Democratic base. His problem is that those people are disproportionately in red states -- that is, states that tend to vote Republican.""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/where-are-the-47-of-americans-who-pay-no-taxes/262499/The one fact, that 46% of Americans do not pay federal income tax, is undisputed.  [That is true](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3505).  We do not know if those voters vote for Obama or not, but [knowing that those with a lower income typically vote Democratic](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/income-and-voting/), Romney assumes they will and speaks as if they are the Democratic party base.  We do not actually have data on that specific 46%, but generally, low-income Americans vote for Democrats.  I agree with breadworshipper - Romney is talking strategy here.  He's referring to the Democratic party base, who he does not have to appeal to.  There are a group of voters that you simply do not try to convince in an election.  That's what Romney is talking about here.  He uses the numbers loosely; this is a quote cut from a speech where he probably elaborates on this more.this 47% is made up of, 2/3 of this is people paying payroll tax, so the working poor, the majority of the remainder are retired people that are on social security, the rest is a combination of people earning less than 20,000 a year, and troops that don't pay income tax cause they're on combat deployment. That leaves a very small percent. Not to mention he says he doesn't care about theses Americans and they'll never vote for him, but guess what Mitt they DO vote for you. 9 out of the 10 most dependent on government program states, are red states.OK outside of claims that Romney was talking about two separate 47% groupings of Americans (which Romney's statements on the video and his clarifying statements today contradict) or claims that this was all hyperbole and was meant only loosely and should not be taken literally (even though he included a very specific number in his claims), I see no fact based evidence that this political claim by Governor Romney is anything but false.  If any further clarification comes out of Team Romney, or any other facts, we'll relook. But so far this may or may not have been motivated by hyperbole, but the words he chose to use are inaccurate.And this:According to Gallup's polling from the tracking period of Aug. 27-Sept. 16, 34 percent of voters whose household incomes are less than $24,000 a year support Romney.  http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/gallup-one-third-of-lowest-income-voters-supportI think this is a statement of two things:1) An opinion, that Obama's base is of people who are ""dependent on government...pay no income tax,"" etc.  Romney is using them as examples of people he won't get through - he's effectively writing them off as people he can get support on.  The end of the statement as edited by Mother Jones supports this, as Romney says that his focus needs to be on that 10% of people who probably pay income tax and can be convinced of the policies he wants to implement.2) The fact itself, the 47% who pay no federal income tax, which is easily verified: http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3505And this isn't sourced (unfortunently) but might help us find sources:""Got that? Romney is conflating the people who pay no net income tax with the people so dependent on government aid that they have to vote for Obama. But these aren't the same people! Most of the ""lucky duckies,"" to use the classic WSJ term, are old people who subsist on Social Security. Elderly voters broke big for Republicans in 2010. Scores of poor whites who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit vote for Republicans.""mobile.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/09/17/mitt_romney_47_gaffe_what_was_he_trying_to_say_.htmlSome fact checking with sourcing here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/mitt-romney-caught-on-video-tape/2012/09/17/38578a5e-012f-11e2-b257-e1c2b3548a4a_blog.html?hpid=z2According to this GALLUP Poll, only 9% identify w/ hard left while 21% identify w/ hard right.20% identify w/ left the most, 40% identify w/ right the most.37% identify as moderatesWhich leads me to believe the majority of independent voters vote for democrats, while repulbicans maintain over a 2:1 ratio of hardliners.http://www.livescience.com/17534-life-extremes-democrat-republican.htmlWell, it's less than 47%.Taking out those whose sole income is Social Security (retirees, people on SSI) or TANF reduces it to less than 40%. No cites, just off the top of my head (and downthread, where 4.1% of the population receives ""welfare"", however they define that).Then we need to consider total population versus voting age population. A kid with a paper run and a bank account is counted in the first instance but not the second.It's not easy to get an answer, other than ""less than Mitt Romney would have you believe"".A lot of people are misrepresenting what he said.  47% was Obama's approval rating at the time and 47% of people pay no income taxes. They are not the same group of people, it's just a coincidence that they're they're the same.He wasn't calling all Obama supporters freeloaders, he was calling the 47% that pay no income tax freeloaders.People are upset because a huge chunk of that 47% isn't people on welfare, it's retired people, students, working poor, etc. And while they don't pay income tax, they still pay local taxes and payroll tax, so they're not really freeloaders. And the retired people used to pay taxes and the students will be paying taxes, so it's really unfair to refer to them as a bunch of lazy mooches."
434,"Keep the quality up and the users well link to it, thus bringing in more users.You need a few agents attempting to make this thing go viral behind the scenes without being callous about it.  The media can be easily manipulated into giving you the coverage you deserve, there just needs to be some kind of novelty that people find amusing.Bad Example:  Find a live morning show with a crowd in the background, wait for a liar politician to bullshit on the show, and attempt to fact check the guy live using signs before the producers can figure out what's going on.  It would take a shitload of coordination though...I personally would love to see a Fact Check Super PAC.  I get so very annoyed when I see Super PAC commercials for both parties spouting ridiculous statements and misinformation.  I realize that it is probably a pipe dream.Keep linking it all over /r/politics and reddit. There are many people tired of the bias and one-sided circlejerking. People come to reddit for many things, learning is one of them which is why we need facts.I recommend opening the sub to non-American political fact-checking at some point in the next couple months. This could really help cushion any drop in interest (that may or may not occur) after November. I think it would be good to at least experiment with the idea.It seems superficially that non-American politicians (in countries with a lot of Redditors, at least) are a little more averse to lying publicly. In Canada for example, there's an impression that the media actually fills the role of fact-checking to a point where you can't just lie in the middle of a campaign. It would be interesting to see how much truth there is to this."
435,"To start off. I think if you're going to make the argument of what the President inherited, then all statistics should begin in the last few months of the previous administration, and the first few month of his administration. I say first few months, as that is his first chance to promote and sign any legislation, and all legislation passed at a national level needs a few months to see any direct effect.>Credit rating - AAA to AA, well, I fail to see how that is Obama's ""fault"" the banks did that to themselves and in proxy effects the rest of the world. My opinion on this is that the piss poor job the banks did handing out loans and fleecing the public contributed to this. I could be totally wrong about this.The Credit downgrade was not to our individual banks, but to our Federal government. Is it the President's fault? No. Not solely. It could hypothetically be argued that he could have done a better job ""leading"", but again that makes the argument come down to opinions. You can find the downgrade report from [Standard and Poors - here](http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316529563)They did specifically mention Congress' inability to work together as a contributing factor>The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy. Despite this year's wide-ranging debate, in our view, the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge, and, as we see it, the resulting agreement fell well short of the comprehensive fiscal consolidation program that some proponents had envisaged until quite recently. Republicans and Democrats have only been able to agree to relatively modest savings on discretionary spending while delegating to the Select Committee decisions on more comprehensive measures. It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as key to long-term fiscal sustainability.>Our opinion is that elected officials remain wary of tackling the structural issues required to effectively address the rising U.S. public debt burden in a manner consistent with a 'AAA' rating and with 'AAA' rated sovereign peers (see Sovereign Government Rating Methodology and Assumptions,"" June 30, 2011, especially Paragraphs 36-41). In our view, the difficulty in framing a consensus on fiscal policy weakens the government's ability to manage public finances and diverts attention from the debate over how to achieve more balanced and dynamic economic growth in an era of fiscal stringency and private-sector deleveraging (ibid). A new political consensus might (or might not) emerge after the 2012 elections, but we believe that by then, the government debt burden will likely be higher, the needed medium-term fiscal adjustment potentially greater, and the inflection point on the U.S. population's demographics and other age-related spending drivers closer at hand>Compared with previous projections, our revised base case scenario now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end of 2012, remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the act. Key macroeconomic assumptions in the base case scenario include trend real GDP growth of 3% and consumer price inflation near 2% annually over the decade.I think its fairly clear that the President shares a role in the blame, but S&P clearly pointed at Congress' inability to fix the problem as the main contributing factor to their downgrade. *The Average Unemployment Rate Claim*It seems your link went to a specific chart, and is unavailable. I might be linking to the same chart, but here is also the [BLS - Unemployment Rate by Month - Year](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000)I would be hesitant to hold ANY president to unemployment numbers. Unemployment numbers are dependent on the national economy. I don't believe I need a source to say that no American president can control the economy, all they can do is enact legislation to helps guide the economy.The unemployment numbers are reflective of the economy, and *partially* the president's policies and what they have signed. But for arguments sake, lets do the math. 2008 - Unemployment Rate by Month (Bureau of Labor Statistics link I provided)| Month | Rate |  | :----- | -----|  |Jan      | 5.0%||Feb      |4.9%|March  |5.1%|April  |5.0%|May  |5.4%|June  |5.6%|July  |5.8%|Aug  |6.1%|Sept  |6.1%|Oct  |6.5%|Nov  |6.8%|Dec|7.3%The first 6 months of 2009 (ibid.)| Month | Rate |  | :----- | -----|  |Jan      | 7.8%||Feb      |8.3%|March  |8.7%|April  |8.9%|May  |9.4%|June  |9.5%We know that the Stimulus bill was passed in February 2009, for arguments sake (and this is opinion and not fact checking). Lets give a a month intermediate period when money was appropriated and sent out, before we see any changes so that leaves us at an 8.7% unemployment rate that is inherited. Is it accurate to say that the average rate of unemployment was 5.8% in 2008? Yes. But that largely ignores the actual details that the unemployment rate increased by 1.5% in the last 6 months of 2008.Which really brings us to the point that, the claim that the 9% average is true, but it is not entirely a reflection on the administration. The same way the increase in the last half of 2008 cannot be entirely a reflection on the Bush administration. It increased and decreased because of the private sector.The claim is true, but it is partisan bias. They are using private sector statistics to make the government look bad. Personal opinion again, but whether someone is railing against a republican or a democrat, using unemployment numbers against them is incredibly misleading.There is a lot of pressure put on the National Budget but in the end it is nothing more than a request/opinion. The government is not going to shut down if the budget is not official. Obama has proposed a budget, it just has not been ratified.**Gas Prices**  Show them this [chart](http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx) (select for 8 years).  A few months before the economy crashed, the average price of gas in the US was $4.11 a gallon and oil was selling for $147 a barrel.  The price of gas dropped when the financial players who had been running the price up crashed with the mortgage fiasco.  The speculators left the market and the price dropped.http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/2008-us-gas-price-year-in-review.html**Credit Rating**Newaccts gives a good explanation.  S&P was particularly unimpressed with Congress playing games with the debt ceiling.And only S&P gave us a AA+ (not AA) rating.  For the other credit rating agencies (the other two big ones are Moody's and Fitch), the US is still AAA. **Debt**[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_public_debt) is a really good page to read.  Note that of the current annual deficit, more than 1/3 is a result of the economic crisis of 2008 and all the people that were laid off, 1/3rd is blamed directly on Bush policies, and a little less than 1/3rd is due to Obama's policies to try to get people back to work.  Since the economic crisis rests on the combination of the Republican House and Senate while Clinton was president, Clinton signing off on eliminating Glass-Steagall (probably to keep Republicans from voting for impeachment), and Bush policies, you might also place blame for the annual deficit like this:|**Percent of Blame**|**Person/Group Responsible**||:---------:|:----------||9%|Clinton||9%|Republican House and Senate in late 90s||9%|Republican House and Senate from 2002-2006||42%|George Bush's policies||30%|Obama's policies|    I've also seen various sources that blame the economic crisis and its negative impact on Bush's last year, and that his last budget increased government spending by nearly 50%.    Many sources put the real debt at the end of his presidency and last budget at about 12 trillion, not 10 trillion.  **Job Growth**Anyone can tell, even from the graph you sourced, that we did not have job growth from February 2007 until late in 2009, and even then it was flat.  It really didn't start to improve until the spring of 2010, and it back-slid when all the census workers were laid off in late summer 2010.I'd like to call 'Partisan Bias' on this: ""This claim contains obvious political bias intended to edify one party or make another party look bad."""

437,"The emerging theory I've been trying to follow is that there are certainly protests sparked by the film (which then cause a recursive loop) but the attack on the Libyan Embassy may have been unrelated and either exploiting the protests as an opportunity or simply correlative.The thing is, even if the *initial* attack wasn't a protest in response to the video, the media's reporting of it as such contributed to the proliferation of the video which in turn spawned protests which genuinely are reacting to the video.This is going to be hard to source. There aren't a lot of public records produced by the various protesters. I'm trying to find a primary source for the think tank quoted [here](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/us-ambassador-killed) (the quote doesn't seem to be in the linked CNN article.)I think the better question is who made/edited the trailer.  It exists for sure but the details surrounding its origin and the extremely fast proliferation months after it was available online (on 9/11) are much more suspect.http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ztiew/reviewing_all_of_the_current_reported_facts/I'd like to piggyback this with a request for reliable estimates of the size of the protests in each country.  Because I haven't seen anyone talking about the number of protesters, and I think that should be really important to how they are viewed.Here's an article in [USAToday](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012/09/12/deadly-embassy-attacks-were-days-in-the-making/57752828/1) that makes the claim that the Cairo protests were planned well before the Egyptians knew about a video.Many of the video reports I've seen (at least on the BBC) show protesters making remarks that suggest the Prophet Muhammad had been insulted (the one I remember particularly well was one person calling for such an action to be illegal under international law).I have seen the video (though I can't seem to find it again), but it was clearly an attack on the prophet.  The video wasn't even that good, really.I'd rate this as True.I think the video in question is what about 15 people in the Middle East saw and decided to riot. Then group mentality showed up and everyone is killing each other and burning shit. Next month I'm sure we'll see riots blamed on Halloween or something similar. The thing about the terrorist attacks/riots in the Muslim communities is that they don't NEED any particular reason to go and destroy things, it just lets them do it without everyone go at their throats at once.I would rate this as False.    [watch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M86ndC4V7EQ&feature=youtu.be ) for some examples of why.The question you should be asking is what motivation does the US government have in deflecting the public perception of these attacks being against *US foreign policy* and instead pointing the finger at an obscure youtube video?"
438,"[this site](http://library.thinkquest.org/C002291/high/present/stats.htm) claims 8M people die per year due to hunger (last bullet point). But it contradicts itself because earlier is claims 15M children die from hunger each year. (Also I think the site is quite old)[FAO](http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/) claims 925M people are in hunger per year, but doesn't list deaths.[This reporting of a UNICEF claims](http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats) claims ~5M children die per year of starvation, but doesn't list total for adults.[This well-cited wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation) shows that the trend for undernoursed people in the world is declining, which probably means fewer people are starving as a percentage.On the other side:[This report claims 300K deaths due to obesity in the US](http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm), but doesn't say anything about worldwide[This well-cited wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity#Effects_on_health) claims an additional 1M deaths for Western Europe, and also cites sources says Obesity is either the largest or second largest ""preventable"" cause of death, but says nothing about ""all causes"". Presumably starvation is a 'preventable' cause. **TL;DR** Nobody really knows the total numbers of death for starvation or obesity. Had Bloomberg said ""the US"" instead of ""the world"", he would have been trivially true (less than 300 people died in the US of starvation), but saying ""the world"" puts him on shaky groundEDIT: [Preventable Causes of Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death) lists malnutrition killing 3.8M per year and obesity killing 2.5M a year, but is from 2001. With starvation on a downward trend and obesity on an upward trend it's possible but we don't have the data to say.According to the [WHO](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/), ""At least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese"" and ""Overweight and obesity are linked to more deaths worldwide than underweight.""According to the World Health Organization: [65% of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/)I haven't looked into the statistics themselves, but I would think it would be difficult to adjust for this kind of thing.What I mean is that I believe that obesity, while a killer, will most likely kill people much later in life than starvation would.  So even if the statistic is true, if a man dying of an obesity induced heart attack at 55 is counted the same as an 8 year old starving, is it still really accurate?I'll toss this book into consideration: http://www.amazon.com/The-Obesity-Myth-Obsession-Hazardous/dp/1592400663> Is your weight hazardous to your health? According to public-health authorities, 65 percent of us are overweight. Every day, we are bombarded with dire warnings about America’s ""obesity epidemic."" Close to half of the adult population is dieting, obsessed with achieving an arbitrary ""ideal weight."" Yet studies show that a moderately active larger person is likely to be far healthier (and to live longer) than someone who is thin but sedentary. And contrary to what the fifty-billion-dollar-per-year weight-loss industry would have us believe medical science has not yet come up with a way to make people thin.> After years spent scrutinizing medical studies and interviewing leading doctors, scientists, eating- disorder specialists, and psychiatrists, Professor Paul Campos is here to lead the backlash against weight hysteria—and to show that we can safeguard our health without obsessing about the numbers on the scale.Campos did an interview with Megan McArdle at *The Atlantic* seen here: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/07/americas-moral-panic-over-obesity/22397/> Megan: Let's start with the first. If there's one thing that everyone in America knows, it's that being fat is really unhealthy. Why do you call it a fake problem?> Paul: The correlations between higher weight and greater health risk are weak except at statistical extremes. The extent to which those correlations are causal is poorly established. There is literally not a shred of evidence that turning fat people into thin people improves their health. And the reason there's no evidence is that there's no way to do it. > So saying ""let's improve health by turning fat people into thin people"" is every bit as irrational as saying ""let's improve health by turning men into women or old people into young people"". Actually it's a lot crazier, because there actually are significant health differences between men and women and the old and the young -- much more so than between the fat and the thin.> Megan: So why is the public health community so set on this issue as the major driver of our health care costs?> Paul: Because we're in the midst of a moral panic over fat, which has transformed the heavier than average into folk devils, to whom all sorts of social ills are ascribed.More about the science and thought process regarding obesity is here, also McArdle: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/07/thining-thin/22436/Q: Should we consider social inequality as a factor for obesity? If so, I believe that would skew Bloomberg's answer to false. As I recall, social inequality leads to more obesity and less life expectancy. I just think he's parsing a problem that is more easily solved with a view of the bigger picture."

The rallies were pre-planned for 9/11, and the ""film"" was used as popular justification for violence.And this: ""According to our sources, the attack was the work of roughly 20 militants, prepared for a military assault; it is rare that an RPG7 is present at a peaceful protest,"" Benotman said.""That analysis is supported by U.S. sources who say the attack on the consulate is believed to have been pre-planned. The sources say the attackers used the protest as a diversion to launch the attack, although the sources could not say if the attackers instigated the protest or merely took advantage of it.http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/index.htmlAnd this:The attack that killed four Americans in the Libyan consulate began as a spontaneous protest against the film “The Innocence of Muslims,” but Islamic militants who may have links to Al Qaeda used the opportunity to launch an attack, CIA Director David Petreaus told the House Intelligence Committee today according to one lawmaker who attended a closed-door briefing.http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/al-qaeda-took-advantage-of-libyan-protest-cia-chief-says/According to the UK Independent, the US was warned but did nothing:http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/revealed-inside-story-of-us-envoys-assassination-8135797.html> According to senior diplomatic sources, the US State Department had credible information 48 hours before mobs charged the consulate in Benghazi, and the embassy in Cairo, that American missions may be targeted, but no warnings were given for diplomats to go on high alert and ""lockdown"", under which movement is severely restricted.> That the attackers knew the locations of safe houses also speaks to some planning as opposed to spontaneous protests going bad.It's also been reported in an op-ed by Marc Thiessen that Obama doesn't normally attend security briefings, simply receiving the PDB daily:http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obama-alone-this-president-does-not-need-intel-briefers/2012/09/13/c11e1a52-fda5-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html> When I asked National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor if the president had attended any meetings to discuss the Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) since Sept. 5, he repeatedly refused to answer. He noted that Obama had attended a principals meeting of the National Security Council on Sept. 10 and reiterated that he reads the PDB.This is key context regarding the scope of the attacks that we're seeing coming into today, and how mismanagement of useful intel that was ignored (speaking directly to the planning of the attacks) help escalate a situation that may have been manageable.  Had the US acted on the intelligence it appears they had, the scope and/or scale of the attacks could have been diminished, if not outright thwarted.Great question here, I'm removing the original post to focus very specifically on this core of Zythos' question.I'm thinking this one can be called at least ""mostly true"" based on the research here. The attacks themselves seemed to at least have been militants looking for an opportune time to carry out the attacks and the mob became that opporunity, but seems like at least some pre-planning occured as they were just waiting for a window to strike.So as it is at LEAST mostly true, I'm marking it as such. More details may come in that bring it up to confirmed.This is great. Y'all are awesome.  Thanks for helping to make this less confusing.

440,"The article itself isn't that good. First, it only gives the numbers for one particular franchiser - which I would hesitate to extend to other franchisers.Second, it says that he would pay an additional  $315k IF he got insurance for everyone. It later says that he could instead just pay the insurance penalty (for $158k) or he could reduce his workforce to more part-timers and avoid that penalty too. So the article itself doesn't even say that it WILL, just that it COULD.He says he pays 81% of his employees healthcare costs. [According the PPACA, he only needs to pay 72.5% for individual and 65% for family plans](http://hrthatworksblog.com/2010/04/05/employer-obligations-under-health-care-reform-act/). So his costs wouldn't have to be that high anyway.Last but not least, this doesn't happen until the other big cost-cutting measures of PPACA come into play in 2014, so it's difficult to say how his premium prices will behave. Ignoring the rest of the law and focusing on just this part doesn't make me confident in those numbers.I would say Mostly False.EDIT: This also ignores his profit margins and his final costs. Just because he has a profit margin of 3% (he claims the increase is equals to 1.5% of sales, or half of profit) doesn't mean that all other small business owners have a similar margin. And it doesn't say he can't increase his prices. I believe most prices are set at the local level (except for certain promotions), so if the 99 cent burger costs $1.09 after this change, his profit margins might be fine.Since this claim is dependent on each individual business, how much they make and how much it would cost to provide insurance for each employee, I'm going to mark this as unverifiable.1.  The numbers appear reasonable.2. It is questionable how many others this applies to, but presumably similar businesses would be hit similarly.3. I've been hearing similar numbers from small business owners I know personally.4. There is no way to verify this without actual accounting statements, so this probably needs to be 'unverifiable'.Unless you are asking ""did a small business owner claim that..."", in which case, the answer is yes.If you delve a tad deeper into this you will see that it will cost less to simply dump everyone onto the government and pay the fine. This was always the intent of Obamacare. After a couple of years of this another crisis will be declared leading to completely socialized medicine."
441,"One thing needs to be taken into account here. The MoveOn graphic says nothing of Bain Capital. It is talking about Bain & Company. Bain Capital is a separate LLC. I've read a few articles on this and the posts that are here. To me personally, this is leaning towards false. As far as I have read, the FDIC received no tax payer money. The money that they use to insure is paid by the banks themselves. I think that is the biggest determination of the validity here. What constitutes a bailout is tricky. There is no irrefutable textbook definition we can reference. For a moment, lets compare it with the 2008 Bush Bailouts of the Banks and the 2009 Obama Bailouts of the auto industry. What both of those have in common was that the Federal government issues loans and capital injections through tax payer money, while at the same time acquiring stakes in those companies, which doesn't seem to be the case with this. The FDIC is an independent government agency. They are beholden by changes made from Congress including: The Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950  The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980  and The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991The Chairman of the FDIC is appointed by the President, following approval by the Senate. While they might not use taxpayer money, they are without a doubt a component of the Federal government. Comparing it to the previous two bailouts will result in one answer, comparing it to other bailouts might change the paramters of what a bailout is. Since this isn't absolutely clear one way or the other, I will give more time for posts to accumulate on whether the FDIC loan restructuring is considered a bailout.  As always. Any personal attacks, irrelevant posts, and clear political arguments will result in deleted comments without notification. Please keep it to the issue on hand. If there are more posts on this topic and with some more time, I'll talk to the other mods and we'll look over the posts and evidence and assign it validity flair.Bain did not get a ""bailout"" in any sense of the word.  What occurred was an FDIC takeover of a bank that had an outstanding loan with Bain, and Romney, with Bain, negotiated the writeoff of the loan via the FDIC.  The best breakdown I've seen is here:http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Romney-s-Bain-Co-Didn-t-Get-Federal-3844257.php>  Biden’s charge that the restructured loan cost the government and taxpayers is wrong. Although Rolling Stone referred repeatedly to a “bailout,” the article made clear that “taxpayers did not finance” it. While the FDIC is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, it is funded by assessments from the banks it insures. No federal money was involved in covering losses from a reduced Bain loan. The article said that the FDIC would have passed losses along in the form of higher bank assessments. Biden spokeswoman Amy Dudley said Bain got “a bailout from an agency ultimately backed up by American taxpayers.” The point, though, is that taxpayers didn’t foot the bill.To quote the NYMag piece about this smear (http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/did-mitt-romney-get-bailed-out-at-bain.html), ""So while Romney's deal may have been unseemly...it didn't screw taxpayers, at least directly.""  Pretty clearly false.It was the exact opposite of a bailout. A bailout is giving a loan to a company of country. Bain Capital had one of its outstanding loans absolved without consequence. **This is false**. Though, making the case for the ""fiscal responsibility"" implications of it all, negotiating to get out paying off a loan is worse. Harder to explain, less sound-byte-y or digestible to the body politic, but still worse.Bailout: *""Mommy and daddy, can I borrow money?""* ""Okay, sure sweetie"".What actually happened:*""Mommy and daddy, you know how I said I was going to pay them back? I don't want to.""*""Okay, sure sweetie""."
442,"Others will fill in the reasons for 300,000 dropping out of the labor force, but he's technically correct. The unemployment rate is a calculation of the number of people without jobs divided by the total labor force. The total labor force is equal to the number of people with jobs + the number of people looking for jobs. We need about 100-125k jobs a month to keep up with population growth to maintain the current unemployment rate, all things equal. So, even though last month only added 96,000 jobs (which should raise the unemployment rate), the denominator got smaller (from people dropping out of the labor force) which meant unemployment actually dropped.All six definitions of unemployment usually move in concert, so if you are not really interested in the absolute values, if you just need a sense of whether the economy is doing well or bad, any one of the definitions will do.[The definitions are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment):* U1:Percentage of labor force unemployed 15 weeks or longer.* U2: Percentage of labor force who lost jobs or completed temporary work.* U3: Official unemployment rate per the ILO definition occurs when people are without jobs and they have actively looked for work within the past four weeks.* U4: U3 + ""discouraged workers"", or those who have stopped looking for work because current economic conditions make them believe that no work is available for them.* U5: U4 + other ""marginally attached workers"", or ""loosely attached workers"", or those who ""would like"" and are able to work, but have not looked for work recently.* U6: U5 + Part-time workers who want to work full-time, but cannot due to economic reasons (underemployment).You can see the chart of [all six measures moving together on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Unemployment_measures.svg)[Here are the various definitions](http://cfecon.blogspot.com/2009/11/10-unemployment-explained-u3-vs-u6-and.html)Unemployment Numbers and what they include:*  U1: Percentage of labor force unemployed 15 weeks or longer.*  U2: Percentage of labor force who lost jobs or completed temporary work.  *  U3: Official unemployment rate per ILO definition.  *  U4: U3 + ""discouraged workers"", or those who have stopped looking for work because current economic conditions make them believe that no work is available for them.  *  U5: U4 + other ""marginally attached workers"", or ""loosely attached workers"", or those who ""would like"" and are able to work, but have not looked for work recently.  *  U6: U5 + Part time workers who want to work full time, but cannot due to economic reasons.So yes, the number reported in the paper, U3, does not use discouraged workers who have stopped looking -- that is included in U4 and the higher numbers.The ""official unemployment rate"" is the U3, which tallies people who ""are without jobs and they have actively looked for work within the past four weeks.""Back around May of this year, Rush Limbaugh first advanced (to my knowledge) the idea that the U6 data ought to be used as the ""real"" unemployment number (despite the U3 - or same data under a different structure - being the standard to date) as it included those that Obama had ""forced out of the work force."" It was at that time that I built the following charts (data only up through April/May of 2012):U3: http://i.imgur.com/WOGYE.jpgU6: http://i.imgur.com/UGIQC.jpgWhichever way you slice it, unemployment's not great and needs to come down, but suddenly deciding that this president needs to take responsibility for U6 data, rather than U3 data (as in the past), is the very definition of moving the goalposts.http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed> Persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. Actively looking for work may consist of any of the following activities:> Contacting:An employer directly or having a job interviewA public or private employment agencyFriends or relativesA school or university employment centerSending out resumes or filling out applicationsPlacing or answering advertisementsChecking union or professional registersSome other means of active job searchPassive methods of job search do not have the potential to result in a job offer and therefore do not qualify as active job search methods. Examples of passive methods include attending a job training program or course, or merely reading about job openings that are posted in newspapers or on the Internet.> Workers expecting to be recalled from temporary layoff are counted as unemployed, whether or not they have engaged in a specific jobseeking activity. In all other cases, the individual must have been engaged in at least one active job search activity in the 4 weeks preceding the interview and be available for work (except for temporary illness).>...>  Excluded are persons under 16 years of age, all persons confined to institutions such as nursing homes and prisons, and persons on active duty in the Armed Forces. As mentioned previously, the labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed. The remainder—those who have no job and are not looking for one—are counted as ""not in the labor force."" The reason the unemployment rate is as low as it is comes directly from what your father said - discouraged workers falling off the unemployment rolls are no longer counted in the general number quoted.  There are a few different numbers out there, a second one includes the people who are still attached but discouraged, etc.So yes, in August, the unemployment rate did go down mostly because 368k people left the labor force: http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/07/news/economy/august-jobs-report/index.htmlNot fact checking.It is hard to really say why 300,000 people dropped out.  You're right retirees leaving the workforce could potentially be driving the number down too, but ultimately we're not creating enough jobs to drive the number down solely through job creation.I had heard at one time that when people are cut off from their unemployment benefits it also removes them from being seen as unemployed.  I don't know if this is accurate, but I would love to know if it is accurate or not.http://www.businessinsider.com/labor-force-shrinks-by-367000--participation-rate-falls-to-its-lowest-level-in-31-years-2012-9You should ask your father if that's his view of the facts even during Republican admins.Also, this article is pretty relevant and deals with unemployment statistics-keeping and which one the media typically use and why that's Pollyanna-ish and unrealistic.http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/05/0082023"
443,"it was the embassy that said:>“The United States Embassy in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims — as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions,” it said, denouncing the “unjustified breach of our embassy.”hillary clinton said :>Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton confirmed late Tuesday that a State Department officer had been killed in the Benghazi attack, and she condemned the violence. “Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” she said.“The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.”source:http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/world/middleeast/anger-over-film-fuels-anti-american-attacks-in-libya-and-egypt.html?_r=1&hp&pagewanted=allpresident obama said:>I strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

And they list their sources. Any other sources?http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/state-dept-confirms-death-in-libya-romney-attacks-disgraceful-white-house.phpAlso this from FactCheck.org:  Mitt Romney claims the Obama administration issued an “apology for American values” after U.S. embassies were attacked. Not true. Romney refers to a statement issued before mobs attacked either in Egypt or Libya, and faults U.S. diplomats for failing to condemn actions that hadn’t yet happened.Furthermore, the word “sorry” or “apologize” doesn’t appear in the statement. Under the headline, “U.S. Embassy Condemns Religious Incitement,” the embassy in Cairo said, “Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy.”Romney has falsely accused Obama of “apologizing for America” many times before. The line has been a dependable applause-getter with conservative audiences. But we found no basis for this claim in Obama’s previous speeches and remarks. And other fact-checkers came to similar conclusions.Getting Things BackwardThis time Romney has gone beyond putting his own unwarranted spin on the president’s statements. He has just gotten his basic facts in the wrong order.Romney appeared on national television the morning of Sept. 12 and said:    Romney, Sept. 12: I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt, instead of condemning their actions. It’s never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values.In response to reporters’ questions, he added:    Romney: The embassy in Cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached. Protesters were inside the grounds. They reiterated that statement after the breach. … I think it’s a — a — a terrible course to — for America to — to stand in apology for our values. That instead, when our grounds are being attacked and being breached, that the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation. An apology for America’s values is never the right course. …    The statement that came from the administration was — was a statement which is akin to apology and I think was a — a severe miscalculation.The fact is, however, that Romney got his sequence of events backward.A TimelineContrary to multiple reports from Fox News, the U.S. embassy in Cairo — not the State Department in Washington — put out the statement on Sept. 11 several hours before a mob of protesters breached the wall of the embassy, took down an American flag and replaced it with a black flag.At 6:11 a.m. Eastern time (around noon Cairo time), the U.S. embassy in Cairo tweeted: “U.S. Embassy condemns religious incitement,” with a link to its full statement. (The tweet was later deleted and the link to the statement was taken down.) A senior administration official who spoke to reporters on a conference call confirmed that the statement was released at about noon Cairo time, which would have been at about 6 a.m. EST. That places the release of the statement several hours before the protest.So Romney was wrong about the statement from the embassy coming in response to the protest. Nor do we see any basis for Romney’s claim that the embassy statement was “apologizing for free speech” and “appeared to be an apology for American principles.""http://factcheck.org/2012/09/romney-gets-it-backward/Not sourced but might help us get sources to the chronology here. This is from the Daily Beast listing their view of the events as they played out: First, the embassy in Cairo--not the White House, not Foggy Bottom, but the embassy--released its statement denouncing (not by name) the makers of the inflammatory film about Mohammed. That was around noon local time Tuesday.Then the attacks happened.Then, last night, came Romney's statement criticizing the Obama administration for its allegedly ""disgraceful..first response"" being ""to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.""But: the attack hadn't happened! That first embassy statement was apparently issued because word was circulating about possible violence, and the embassy was trying to quell it.Then the Obama administration distanced itself from the original embassy statement, and then Romney issued last night's statement.So here's Romney now, at 10:18 am, now that he must surely know this chronology, still defending his statement from last night and criticizing Obama for defending the attackers. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/emphasizing-the-cairo-timeline-after-the-breach-is-the-key-phrase.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29One last link: this to me feels like the simpliest sourced timeline: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/12/us/politics/libya-statements.htmlAlso I'm checking out this from AP on this as well: http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_EMBASSY_ATTACKS_FACT_CHECK?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-09-12-20-05-57One more bit of news here: it seems the Cairo Press release not only was disavoid after it was published, it now is news that the State Department in DC officially asked the embassy NOT to publish it, but they did anyway. From Forbes:However, prior to publication, Mr. Schwartz also forwarded a draft of his press release to the State Department in Washington for review. While the document never reached the desk of the President nor the Secretary of State, the draft was expressly not approved by State Department officials who reviewed the press release and who ordered Schwartz not to publish the statement until he made specific changes and additions that the State Department wanted included.Mr. Schwartz decided to ignore the directive of the State Department and published his draft as he had written it.http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/09/13/time-line-of-cairo-events-reveals-romneys-deeply-flawed-rush-to-judgment/Oh it gets sillier and sillier. Here's what he said in his TV appearance:>    ""This uh attack on american individuals and embassies is outragous, it's disgusting, it uh it breaks the hearts of all of us who think of these people who have served during their lives the cause of freedom and justice and honor. We uh we mourn their loss, and join together in prayer, that the spirit of the allmighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slain.>>    I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathazing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States Goverment to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values. The white house distanced themselves from the statement, saying it wasn't cleared by Washington, and that reflects the mixed signals they're sending to the world.""No need to even fact-check that one, he's saying right there in the speech that the white house is distancing themselves from the statement saying they didn't ""clear"" it (aka, they didn't say it). Hilariously, they point to that as proof that they are sending mixed messages. And on his website/blog:>I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi.>>It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.No mention of the fact the white house didn't say -anything- sympathizing with attackers there. After all, why would Mitt try to qualify or fact-check any of this before jumping on the chance to dance politically on people's dead bodies?Again from TPM, wish they had sourced these but here is their case and maybe we can find the sources:""Romney’s attack was not only ill-judged and ill-timed, it was actually based on what appears to be a demonstrable falsehood. Romney, or folks writing in his name at his campaign, claimed that the administration’s first response to the attacks was to issue a press release condemning the anti-Islam film which had helped trigger the attack. This they picked wholesale from the right-wing blogosphere.In fact, according to all available press reports and the account of the State Department, the press release in question came from the US Embassy in Egypt and preceded the attacks. So to claim it was a response to the attacks was simply false.""  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/09/when_you_learn_theyre_not_ready.php?ref=fpblgCritics from both parties certainly believe Romney made a serious mistake - ""But their efforts (Romney defenders) were largely overshadowed by other members of Team Romney who didn't agree with the candidate's response.""http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/romney-under-friendly-fire-response-libyan-embassy-attack-213729383--election.htmlSo we’re not helped by the Romney camps “claifying” remarks on Wed: * “The embassy in Cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached,” Romney told reporters on Wednesday. “Protesters were inside the grounds. They reiterated that statement after the breach. I think it’s a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values.” *This statement seems to make it clear that the ORIGINAL claim was referring to both the Cario formal “Statement” and their later “reiterating the Statement after the breach” which seems to be the 8pm Tweets that were later deleted.**If so: the first half about the original Cairo statement is clearly vetted as  false now.** Everyone including the Romeny camp now agrees the Cairo statement was not issued “after the grounds have been breached.""  But now Team Romeny seem to be claiming (and Breadworshiper is making this case here) that “no, what Romney was referring to in his claim as the “first response” was not so much the original formal 6:17am Cario embassy statement, but primarily the Tweets that occured at 8pm or so that were issued by the embassy in Cairo. The Romeny claim NOW seems to all come down to this one single tweet from the Cario Embassy which was issued after the breach at around 8pm east: **“This morning's condemnation (issued before protest began) still stands. As does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the Embassy”**So as we try to fact check that thesis, these seem to be the questions: 1. Can the Cairo embassy tweets of about 8pm be shown to be ""The Administration’s first  response to the attacks?""  And not the Hillary announcement at 10:08pm east that states:* “I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers was killed.”* ...nor the 10:10 eastern time clarification on POLITICO that “The statement by Embassy Cairo was not cleared by Washington and does not reflect the views of the United States government.” 2. Does this 8pm Tweet as claimed fail “to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks”?  Here is the Tweet again: “This morning's condemnation (issued before protest began) still stands. As does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the Embassy.”Not sure how this is anything but False so far. The tweet uses the word “condemnation” right there referring to the breach.  And  the “morning condemnation” referenced seems to be referring to the original embassy formal statement. So we should be able to look at that and see if THAT is “sympathizing with those who waged the attacks."" Here is the 6:17am Cairo formal statement again: *""The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims - as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy. We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.""*It does refer to “Muslims” but for Mitt’s claim to be accurate “sympathizing with those who waged the attacks can only be true if you consider the original statement’s reference to “Muslims” as that. Again I don’t see how this is anything but false: this formal Cario statement was not specific to “those militants who waged the attacks.” It is making a broad statement about all Muslim believers. Did I miss anything here?[Here's a complete timeline of the events.](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/12/13831714-timeline-political-fallout-from-the-attack-on-diplomats-in-libya?lite)The key line is this from the Romney campaign: *""It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.""*It looks like the ""first response"" they are referring to is the Egyptian Embassy's 6:17am response, which implicitly condemned the individuals who made the film the Egyptians were rioting about. People appear to be calling the Romney campaign liars because they believe he is saying President Obama et al. are sympathizing with the Bhengazi attackers. That is not the incident his language refers to.Here is what the White House site has. http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libyaThis may also have relevant sources - http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=general&catid=57511914&feed_id=999&videofeed=999. Reading it now....And one more - http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/cairo-libya-attacks-timeline/I'm confused by the way this link is titled. What is being marked ""false""? That the Romney Campaign said that? That it was disgraceful? That Obama's first response was was sympathetic?great job all !!During his remarks today Romney stated ""The President takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth, but the words that come from his ambassadors, from his administration, from his embassies, from his State Department,"" Romney stated. ""They clearly sent mixed messages to the world, and the statement that came from the administration and the embassy is his administration.""   So it sounds as though he's equivocating on what his criticism was really about in the first place, which wasn't the White House's editing or communications decision to put out what the embassy did last night, but now the point is that the administration is sending mixed and weak messages to the world.   http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/romney-obama-responsible-for-apology-issued-after-embassy-attacks/article/2507742National Journal has a good breakdown of the timeline here, including what led to the initial statement from the US embassy in Cairo. http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/timeline-on-egypt-and-libya-undercuts-romney-attack-on-obama-20120912?mrefid=skyboxLet's see if this subreddit is worth being subscribed to.  Here is a timeline of the events in question:  http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/09/12/timeline-of-statements-on-libya-egypt-attacks/Even after the attacks happened, the Embassy released a tweet saying they stood by their initial statement (This tweet has since been deleted, but can be found on numerous other sites).  The Embassy is part of the Obama administration, he appoints the ambassador, and the ambassador is ultimately responsible for anything the Embassy says.  I'm not a Romney fan, but I agree that his statement was correct, and if the embassy disagreed, why did they delete their statement?http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-is-right-in-embassy-incidents-obama-administrations-first-instinct-was-to-sympathize-with-attackers/article/2507749#.UFC9zeXA9IG> First, when embassy staff in Cairo knew there was trouble but before Islamist radicals overran the walls, the embassy released [the] statement:>...> That was before the most serious problems.  Afterward the radicals had breached the walls, torn down the American flag and replaced it with an Islamist banner, the embassy sent out a tweet (now deleted), which said: ""This morning's condemnation (issued before protest began) still stands. As does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the Embassy.""  It is not clear if the embassy actually sent out a statement condemning the breach, but it most certainly sent out a statement condemning any possible offense against Muslim sensibilities.> Then, early Thursday morning, after the extent of the violence in Libya and Egypt was known, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a three-sentence statement, the first two sentences of which addressed possible offense to Muslims.  ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,"" Clinton said.  ""Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."" Clinton's statement was: Regret, affirmation, condemnation, in that order.The issue appears to be with two things:1)  the deleted tweets in question here.  2) Whether the Embassy Twitter account is ""the Obama administration.""Assuming the Embassy speaks for the current administration, then I'd say this is pretty clearly true that the first response was to try and sympathize."
444,"This is untrue. [This ELI5](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) explains the rules: **If you can afford insurance but do not get it, you will be charged a fee.** This is the ""mandate"" that people are talking about...Who can't afford it?Even a cursory analysis reveals the original claim to be ridiculous. The rule is, if the cost of insurance is more than 8% of your income, you do not need to buy insurance, and you do not owe the penalty. And according to [this article on Ehow,](http://www.ehow.com/about_5379492_average-health-insurance-per-person.html), the cost of insurance averages more than $8,000.So unless health care costs drop drastically (by a factor of more than 3, to below $2,300 per year for insurance coverage that qualifies, or less than $200/month,) no-one who drops in this hole of not qualifying for medicare because the sate elected not to participate in the medicare expansion, and are not getting a subsidy from Obamacare because they make under $29,000 (133% of the federal poverty line, where the subsidies to purchase kick in), will owe the tax - they will just be screwed because they lack insurance. Since people who cannot afford it will be exempt, very few will get hit with this penalty except healthy, young, single people with high wages - who do not come close to qualifying for Medicare. If, for a young person in good health, the cost of insurance would be about $5,000/year, they need to make $62,500 in order to owe the tax.Conclusion: **False** (""The claim is blatantly false and flies in the face of truth."")While you may be fined, practically speaking, you might not actually have to pay it.  One thing that no one talks about in this law is that it can't really be enforced;  specifically, any civil or criminal liability is forbidden."
445,"It appears as though the article you posted list it's own citations.  If you click on the anchor that says ""this"" at the top, it links to a NYT article that breaks down the numbers from the CDC study.It didn't start tracking this until 1997, but this is, indeed, the biggest drop in uninsured young adults that we actually have data for.Also worth looking thru on this topic:In 2010, 49.9 million people, or 16.3 percent of the population, lacked coverage. Census officials note that 2010 was the first year after the recession officially ended.The drop in the uninsured was driven in part by a significant reduction among those aged 19 to 25, from 29.8 percent in 2010 to 27.7 percent in 2011, the Census Bureau said.  http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/September/12/census-number-of-uninsured-drops.aspxWell since it allows you to piggy back on your parents employer provided healthcare plans until 26,  I imagine this would cause a massive decrease in the number of youth without health insurance.Something that could be looked at to see for the true/mostly true: If you can get total insured people from insurance companies over time, and compare it to the census at the time, you should be able to see what % of the population is insured at any given point in history. From this, you could make a very weak argument generalizing young people. (IE, if only 80% of the population was insured in 1980, it's unlikely that they had higher young people insurance rates as opposed to 90% in 1990, or 97% in 1997... etc. You see where I'm going with this.)why pay for insurance when the fine costs less than insurance?now, that's only for the first couple years.  the fine will increase to where its more efficient to pay for the health-insurance.I'm just gonna pop on here and say: I lost my insurance coverage because of Obamacare. I'm a student."
446,"Roughly 75% of the price of gasoline is based on the world market prices for crude oil. Higher gasoline prices are primarily the result of three factors: 1) Greater world wide demand, largely China and other Asian countries, 2) Speculation in petroleum commodity markets 3) Minimal impact from a weaker dollar, relative to stronger currencies.Note in the chart of inflation adjusted gasoline prices the bump in the early '70's from the OPEC embargo and the relatively stable prices from then until 2000. What happened in 2000 was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the lifting of speculative limits on trading positions on commodity exchanges. Financial institutions invested heavily in crude oil and petroleum products, as well as in hedging activity, driving prices higher and increasing volatility.http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Gasoline_Inflation.aspWhile the stat is technically true, it's missing massive context. The worldwide recession caused a massive drop in gas prices - the average prices before the recession were much higher. Check the 10 year chart to see it.http://ycharts.com/indicators/gas_pricelook at the massive drop during the recession.This is *partisan bias*, the percentage increase is true but it is obviously cherry-picking of data.When you look at gas prices over a longer period it is apparent that the drop to the low of 2009 was in response to the economic crash, and the plummeting US dollar, failing to mention this is implying that the Obama administration is responsible for gas prices rising.If the economy had have stayed at the disastrously low-levels that it was at when Obama took office then gas prices also would have remained low. However, both the commodities markets and the stock markets have increased dramatically between 2009-2012, and along with them so have gas prices.http://ycharts.com/indicators/gas_priceI'm using this because the gas prices appear to be correct here from what I've seen, and the chart is VERY easy to use.The implication here is that gas prices are up during Obama's term.  Starting on inauguration day, gas price averages were $1.89 a gallon.  Today, gas price averages $3.907 a gallon.  This is actually more than 83% at this point, but I don't know when the ecard was made.The statistic is clearly true.Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was elected, the Energy Information Administration said that the average gallon of gas was $1.84.http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=WThat should be the official word."

449,"This is slippery ground. ""Saved"" or ""Savings"" are often used to refer to estimates and future costs. For Example: I just saved the American taxpayers trillions of dollars by not agreeing with Joe's idea that our automobile industry should convert cars to run on laughter (with a small monitor in each car displaying 24/7 cat videos to get the needed reaction).  -Mythical ObamaNow, the linked articles do mention that healthcare users have received 1.1 billion dollars in healthcare rebates, as the healthcare industry essentially overcharged them and had to pay them back. While these are not technically savings (because they were paid to the insurance companies and still had to come out of the family's monthly budget) they could be seen as savings in the effect that they went back to the customers. (Much like Superman saving Lois Lane and returning her to solid ground... always falling, that lady) As for the 1.0 billion saved by consumers, those numbers are based on projections made with the idea of letting healthcare costs run their normal course. An analogy for this would be if your spouse made you eat better for a year, then after that year, bragged to friends that they saved you from an early death, or that they postponed your high blood pressure (or other related middle age condition). I'm leaning towards Mostly True at the moment, but I did about 10 minutes worth of work looking at the provided links. If anyone has better research, better materials, step right up.A more precise headline would be, ""Obamacare has saved a set of consumers $2.1 billion.""The problem with imposing limits on insurers' profits or costs (of any kind) is that firms will shift that cost onto consumers elsewhere. This is a general principle of economics, popularized by the phrase, ""There is no such thing as a free lunch."" I'd like to channel my inner Star Wars and rule it: ""From a certain point of view.""Folks seem to say here this is ""mostly true"" in that the original claim is accurate but does lack some context. Marking it as such."

I'll be checking the numbers, but I'm at work so bear with me.edit: I can't find any corroborating evidence for this. Romney's ""tax plan"" is also very vague, here are some [definites](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax):* Cut taxes by 20% across the board* Cut Corporate rate by 10% from 35 to 25%.* Keep dividends the same. Mostly false?""Up to"" is weasel wordy, even a tax cut of $1 would qualify, point # 1.Secondly, there is no Romney tax plan. There are some Romney budget goals, and some Romney rhetoric about how those goals might be met, but there's no 'tax plan' available in the public domain.If there is an actual plan, with details, I would love to know it.I think this is firmly in the 'unverifiable' category without the tax plan being available.http://images.politico.com/global/2012/09/hanlon_adelsonc4brief.htmlFrom this, half of the points are trying to say that maintaining current tax rates is somehow a tax cut. That's a disingenuous claim *at best*. The claims Romney wants to raise taxes on the middle class are also disingenuous at best. [Romney himself has said he wouldn't](http://bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2012/09/09/mitt-romney-contrary-what-democrats-are-saying-not-going-increase-tax-burden-middle-income-families/8JLOWvVGYHNZANqn6ZPI6K/story.html), and the claims otherwise come from people filling in the blanks to make his tax plans ""add up"" - since when have revenue/spending plans in DC added up?I would just note that the figure for the estate tax is extremely disingenuous. This figure assumes Adelson would take the reduced exemption amount Obama proposes and then do absolutely no other estate planning, paying the full tax rate on everything else. The authors helpfully drop a footnote indicating that he *could* reduce his estate tax liability through planning. It is a virtual certainty that a guy with billions of dollars in assets already has a complicated estate plan utilizing various trusts and inter vivos gifts to avoid as much tax as possible. The article's estate tax figure buries this fact in a footnote and ignores it so it can focus on a disingenuous number that is most certainly not accurate.The ""tax cut"" he'd receive from dividends seems like an issue of semantics. [Here is the link to the CAP report originally cited.](http://images.politico.com/global/2012/09/hanlon_adelsonc4brief.html)Pay attention to footnote 8. The intuition is that President Obama is going to let dividend rates increase from the current 15% up to personal income tax rates. Since a theoretical President Romney would keep that at a low rate, the difference between taxes would be the $119 million cited. Except...Adelson is already paying the low rate right now. To call it a tax cut makes it seem like he's paying a high rate right now and he'll see his tax bill fall in the future. It's more accurate to say his tax liability for dividends will remain the same as it is right now.I think a more accurate portrayal of the story is: ""Adelson would not see his dividend taxes rise by ~100 million under Mitt Romney's tax plan.""Does that feel different than calling it a tax cut to anyone else?I agree with the critcisms that this article uses some weasel words such as ""up to $2 billion"" and I also agree that the Romney tax plan is not precise. But it does seem like in any scenario Adelson would see great benefit. Perhaps ""half true""? What do folks think?"
453,"I think we need to detail what exactly is being fact-checked here. I believe the claim is that Fox News is complaining about this Presidential Proclamation [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/10/presidential-proclamation-patriot-day-and-national-day-service-and-remem) presented on September 10th, 2012 in regards to Patriot Day. The rebuttal is that the President released a 9/11 related Presidential Proclamation [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/07/presidential-proclamation-national-days-prayer-and-remembrance-2012) 3 days earlier on Sept. 7th 2012. This proclamation does indeed include reference to God.  If that is what the issue is, then it's cut and dried on the side of Media Matters.  But is that the issue? That's what I think we should strive to lock down in concrete. What exactly are we trying to check?Owennb's research I think got it right. Marking this one False. Fox and Friends were misinforming their viewers.I'm pretty sure ""why is God being left out again?"" was a reference to the Democratic platform leaving ""God"" out, not other 9/11 statements like Media Matters claims."

456,"The title is false....for one.Not sure I have time to fact-check this right now, but as an aside, I'd like to see the community submit more stuff like this, in addition to the campaign quotes, as long as it's verifiable.People are increasingly receiving their information via forwards, emails, etc, and many of these are produced by third parties with no attribution. I know I have relatives who lap this stuff up with a spoon. Would love for some easy-bullet rebuttals to send them.I would love to see all this debunked, the problem is that so much of it is hearsay and speculation.  For instance, the name change theme that runs through the video. What your parents (or the school secretary) writes down on a elementary school register (or other forms) in Indonesia is not legally binding in the U.S.  And being born an American citizen (because his mother was an American citizen) I don't believe that's something that gets renounced when you leave the country. It's voluntary and I believe requires some paperwork.  The whole Barry Sotero as a college student has been mostly seen as an April Fool's joke by snopes.com but other sources seem to treat it as fact (and by other sources, I mean people I've talked to who are birthers). A lot of what I saw was pure implication. Like saying ""Hitler was a vegetarian, Michelle Obama has a vegetable garden"" Coincidence?There are lots of claims in the video, but just going through the claims about his educational history at Occidental, [Factcheck](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/05/was-obama-born-in-the-usa/) were able to contact representatives from Occidental who said Obama did not attend under a Fulbright scholarship, nor did he use the name 'Barry Soetero'.As for the claims that Obama 'touched' Marxist literature... well, yes, but reading Das Kapital is one thing, the underlying implication that the book influenced his doctrine is a separate issue altogether.The quote from his book is accurate, but [the context](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/coilofrage.asp) around the quote can affect your interpretation of what he was trying to say. As I've not read his book I'll refrain from passing comment.Page 1 claims his politics are ""Socialist"". There is a Socialist in the US Senate - Bernie Sanders - [who says Obama is no socialist](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/07/actual-socialist-bernie-sanders-no-obama-is-not-a-socialist/). It also says, ""Status: Unclear"". Huh?The second page is about Obama's father - the video claims he's Muslim, but Wikipedia, citing an Obama quote from a Time magazine article said that he was born Muslim but was not practicing, and was atheist. Also I don't think there's much known about the political views of his father, except for the article he wrote, ""[Problems facing our Socialism](http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_eastafrica.html)"". The rest of the panel seems true.The third panel is about Stanley Dunham, Obama's mother. This panel seems true to me!Fourth panel, about how Stanley & Barack Sr met, married & divorced: True.Fifth panel goes ""birther crazy"", using the word ""allegedly"" about Obama's birthplace. It's been established multiple times and multiple ways where Obama was born. Delivering doctor, Google "" Dr. David A. Sinclair"". Copies of the birth certificate are also widely available online. So, Mostly False here.Sixth panel - I can't find information whether Lolo Soetoro officially adopted Obama. The rest of the panel is true.Panels 7/8 - Showing first grade records. I'm OK with them citing that. It says he never ""changed his name back"", but then again I don't see any records of him officially changing his name in the first place.Panel 9 Implies that Obama ""changed his citizenship"" to Indonesian. Surely giving up citizenship would be a major undertaking. No records shown either way.Page 10 calls Obama ""Barry Soeroto"" but states (truly) that he was sent to live with his grandparents.Panel 11 states that his grandparents were communists. I can't find any evidence to support this.---Maybe someone else can take it from here.I'll deal with the points that are actually relevant to anything:Title: False.Obama won't release his long form birth certificate: False.BBC reported the certificate as being released on 27 April 2011: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13212230.  Video is dated 16 June 2011.Barack enrolled as an Indonesian citizen: Likely.  True, according to his school records.  That said, he never did renounce his American citizenship, which means as far as America was concerned, he was a dual citizen.  http://www.wnd.com/2008/08/72656/Obama said under oath that he used no other names: Unverifiable.  Can find neither a transcript nor a video.  I don't see why this would be asked, but I can't say with certainty.Obama's actions have threatened the US Constitution: Pants On Fire.  No evidence of such.Obama's actions have increased the debt/deficit: Half True.  Forgot the context of having a nose-diving economy.Obama has failed to keep his promises: Half True.  Many he's kept, many he hasn't.Obama has used multiple social security numbers: False.  There is no evidence to support this.Obama uses the SSN for someone else: False.  The SSN is allegedly not on the Social Security Death Index according to http://www.obamaconspiracy.org/2010/02/obamas-social-security-number/My overall rating of this video: Partisan Bias.The overwhelming portions of this video are about the President's personal history, and not his political policies or their effects. The conclusion of the video says his actions have hurt the constitution, irritated our allies, and encouraged our enemies. That is all opinion wrapped in speculation. I'm marking this as Partisan Bias, if anyone disagrees feel free to reply back to this and explain why."
457,"Roughly true for federal taxes: lower earners have taxes withheld but then get a nice tax return leaving $0 liability.False generally speaking. In most states, they will still pay some income tax, and not receive a refund for the full sum.Furthermore, they will still pay social security, etc taxes. So will their employers, or they will pay a self-employment tax.Finally, they still pay property tax, sales tax, gas tax, and so on, depending on the state and various other factors (what they buy, whether they drive, and so forth.)It'll be a rare person who actually pays zero tax of any sort. You'd have to find someone who earns little or no money above the table, nor owns property in most states, nor buys anything in most states, nor pays for gas, and so on.Federal taxes only: http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43373-06-11-HouseholdIncomeandFedTaxes.pdfYou can trust that when someone is talking about taxes, they're probably wrong - on the left and right. The only way that statement can be interpreted as correct is if you're only talking about federal income taxes. The bottom 50% don't end up paying any income tax. In 2009, the bottom 20% of income-earners had a 1% total average federal tax rate. The next 20% had a 6.8% total average federal tax rate. The top 1% paid 22.3% of the nation's taxes in 2009. They had a 28.9% total average federal tax rate. This number will be higher now, because the recession temporarily removed more money from the rich than the poor. Federal taxes are progressive, while state+local taxes are slightly regressive.Technically, everyone pays taxes of some sort.  There is a sales tax in most states.  Gasoline also has built in taxes at both the federal and state level.  As for income tax, I know that a lot of people pay very little or nothing, but that does not mean they are not paying any taxes.Only applies to federal income tax, nothing else. So they are literally ignoring every other federal tax, payroll tax, sales tax, etc in the country to get the answer they want.[Not true.](http://ntu.org/tax-basics/who-pays-income-taxes.html) they pay ~3%. Top 1% pays 36%.Does anyone know of a website that I could go to and type in my current salary and it would tell me what percentile I am in?The issue gets muddied on both sides. Yes, there are deductions for things like kids, state taxes, morgtage interest rates and a few other items, in addition people who make, say, 55k a year are not paying taxes on all that as they will have insurance and 401k savings come out of their checks before the tax rate is applied to them.  I will end up paying about $8k in taxes this year once all my returns are accounted for, mostly thanks to the mortgage income tax credit.  That 8K is before I pay payroll taxes as well, which no one but the ultra rich get out of (sort of).I heard it was true, so it must be true, right?"
458,"Yes AND No.It appears he has changed his mind repeatedly over the past few days, which I interpret he has not yet figured out whether to appease the polls or his base.Is there a /r/politicalfactchecking icon to indicate that a statement was 'doublespeak' or otherwise self-contradictory?Here is the link to Team Romney's comments to the National Review after the NBC interview: http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/316367/re-romney-and-obamacare-katrina-trinkoKey here is this including a reference to an earlier Romney quote:-- In reference to pre-existing conditions, a Romney aide responds, “Governor Romney will ensure that discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous coverage is prohibited,” and refers me to these remarks Romney made in Florida in June:    I also want to make sure that people can’t get dropped if they have a preexisting condition. . . . So let’s say someone has been continuously insured and they develop a serious condition and let’s say they lose their job or they change jobs, they move and they go to a new place. I don’t want them to be denied insurance because they’ve got some preexisting condition. So we’re going to have to make sure that the law we replace Obamacare with assures that people who have a preexisting condition, who’ve been insured in the past are able to get insurance in the future so they don’t have to worry about that condition keeping them from getting the kind of health care they deserve.Grist for the discussion, here is Wonk Blog's take: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/09/romney-does-have-a-plan-for-pre-existing-conditions-heres-how-it-would-and-wouldnt-work/I think I'm gonna mark this as either unverifiable, or false (as in, Romney _does_ support giving insurance to those with preexisting conditions). Here is a [Romney quote](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/316367/re-romney-and-obamacare-katrina-trinko):>I also want to make sure that people can’t get dropped if they have a preexisting condition. . . . So let’s say someone has been continuously insured and they develop a serious condition and let’s say they lose their job or they change jobs, they move and they go to a new place. I don’t want them to be denied insurance because they’ve got some preexisting condition. So we’re going to have to make sure that the law we replace Obamacare with assures that people who have a preexisting condition, who’ve been insured in the past are able to get insurance in the future so they don’t have to worry about that condition keeping them from getting the kind of health care they deserve.As you can see, he's using the term ""pre-existing condition"" wrong here. ----[Here's](http://video.msnbc.msn.com/nightly-news/48978587/) a video from NBC's Meet The Press that aired on 9/10.""There are a numbers of things I like in health care reform. One is to make sure those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage""----The health care form in Massachusetts that Romney signed into law contain elements that allow those with pre-existing conditions to get coverage. Source: http://www.massresources.org/pcip.html----From [Talking Points Memo](http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/mitt-romney-obamacare-preexisting-condition.php):>His campaign later told TPM he wasn’t signaling a shift in policy and was instead referring to his existing stance in favor of protections on preexisting conditions only for those with continuous insurance coverage — not for first-time or returning buyers.Which doesn't make any sense. If Romney still supports coverage for pre-existing conditions, then this is _not_ a shift in policy, since he supported it in Massachusetts. And protecting coverage for those with continuous insurance is a moot point: they already have insurance, they don't need help from a PCIP.>“He has a comprehensive reform plan; for instance, his own plan will deal with preexisting conditions but not in the same way that Obamacare does,” a campaign aide said.----It seems like Romney and his campaign are not on the same page. To me, it looks like Romney (at least Governor Romney, and Romney on Meet The Press) does support protecting those with pre-existing conditions. However, his campaign aides seem to think differently. **VERDICT:** I will marking this as ""False: Romney does in fact support insurance for those with pre-existing conditions"". Definition of pre-existing condition: somebody who has no insurance, develops an illness, etc., and wants to purchase insurance. I'm basing this on Romney's words from NBC's MTP and his actions in Massachusetts, not what his campaign aides say.This verdict is subject to change, Mitt Romney has history with flip-flopping on issues, and these quotes can be viewed as vague or contradictory."
459,"It's in the Budget Control Act's text.  [Section 251A Enforcement of Budget Goal.](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:4:./temp/~c112IzWB8Y:e53614:)`(4) ALLOCATION TO FUNCTIONS- On January 2, 2013, for fiscal year 2013, and in its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 254(c), OMB shall allocate half of the total reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) for that year to discretionary appropriations and direct spending accounts within function 050 (defense function) and half to accounts in all other functions (nondefense functions).Here is the letter Nora references:“The Budget Control Act represents a victory for those committed to controlling government spending and growing our economy. I applaud Speaker Boehner’s leadership in stopping tax increases on job creators, rejecting President Obama’s demands for a blank check to keep borrowing, and advancing real spending cuts and controls.""http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentprint.aspx?DocumentID=254795Liberal blog Think progress notes: ""The fact that Ryan may have wished that the bill didn’t contain said defense cuts does not absolve him of the fact that he and 201 other Republicans voted for the bill as-passed.""  I don't know the language in the bill, is this correct?I'd like to mark this with some flair, as it's a day old, but I'm still a little confused. Help me out, here's what I can gather so far:* There was a bill called the Budget Control Act (BCA)* This bill contained $1 trillion (or some absurd number) of defense spending cuts, over some period of time.* Ryan voted for this bill and called it a victory* He then criticized President Obama over having supported the billIs this correct? If this is all correct then I will mark the post as True: o'donnel is correct.She is absolutely correct.She is mistaken in thinking that a congressman supports every part of every bill he votes for. There's this thing called compromise..This is a good illustration of where fact checking fails, however. Every congressman has voted for and against everything. Thus, the ""facts"" can easily show that every congressman is a dirty hypocrite."
460,"The first example reads to me like something that is not so much of a prediction. It's kind of two parts: the first is that the plan has tax cuts, and the second is what size those cuts will be. Presumably, all tax predictions are using similar enough numbers that those values shouldn't have much, if any, variation and can be easily checkable.The second one is confusing, as the quote isn't even in that article (so I can't find the context that fact is in), and the top comment goes off on a political rant that is unrelated to the fact, IMO.If there was something like ""X claims this will cost Y jobs over the next Z years"" then I don't think that's something that can be fact checked.I think it can vary by question. If it's something that cannot be proven with facts, then it's nothing more than speculation and has no place here.If it can be factually validated (by proven sources) then it's likely at least worth discussion.Lots of gray lines there. I think we'll have to use our judgment.A totally fair question: our attempts here were to fact check if political claims of future policy effect act were supported (or not) by reliable well sourced research. My first thought is that i like the spirit of this ""But unless the matter involves hard sciences with a definite body of reliable scientific evidence"" but wonder if the metric of ""hard science"" or ""reliable scientific evidence"" might be broadened to ""strong quantifiable evidence"" and ""plurality of issue area research""?  But am open to the argument that this might be too broad. What do people think?Some good stuff here. We're definitely thinking over it."
461,"1. I'd add more mods. A subreddit growing this quickly can spiral out of control quickly. I'd recommend finding some from differing political stances, so that this doesn't (even inadvertently) turn into a liberal circlejerk about how wrong Republicans are all the time.2. Make an archive.3. Refence the subreddit in as many external subreddits as possible.Why is this group different from [http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalFactCheck](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalFactChecks)? If the answer is simply that you were first that's cool.  Just curious.Do we want to keep it one ""fact"" per post or do we want to do groups? For instance should we have a fact check running for when Romney & Obama debate, one for each candidate, or just split out each thing into a separate post? Same things for political ads.I can see pros and cons for each one. For putting them all into one or two posts this will help avoid clutter and makes it a ""one stop shop"" for all the facts you want to check for each debate/ad. At the same time it will make it harder for people to search out and find the content they want later and will likely increase the amount of ""reposts"".Thoughts?Is there any way we can break an archive into different sections in the sidebar? Like: politics, finance, sports, history, pop culture, etc.?  And some may even deserve subsections, like individual candidates or parties in the political section."
462,"He seems to talk about this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy> The Mexico City Policy, also known by critics as the Mexico City Gag Rule and the Global Gag Rule,[1] was an intermittent United States government policy that required all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive federal funding (NT: from the United States Agency for International Development) to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services, as a method of family planning, in other countries. The policy is a political flashpoint in the abortion debate, with Republican administrations adopting it and Democratic administrations rescinding it. The policy was enacted soon after Republican President Ronald Reagan took office in 1984, rescinded by Democratic President Bill Clinton in January 1993, re-instituted in January 2001 as Republican President George W. Bush took office, and rescinded January 23, 2009, 2 days after Democratic President Barack Obama took office.So I would say that yes, it's true.I think this may need a bit more research in one area. Obama certainly did rescind the Mexico City Policy. But can someone confirm for me, did this technically mean that US tax dollars are ""paying for abortions?"" From Politifact:Politifact asks: ""Does the [Mexico-City Policy] removal by Obama means federal tax dollars can fund abortions all over the world?Not so, says Ellen Starbird, deputy director of USAID’s office of population and reproductive health, because regardless of the Mexico City Policy, a 1973 federal law known as the Helms amendment prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries....With the policy’s repeal, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning money. However, longstanding federal law bars any aid from being spent on abortions, and USAID polices how its family-planning grants are spent.""http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-obamas-repeal-policy-means-tax/OK, consensus here seems to be ""Mostly False."" Marking it as such.I'm going to try to defend Romney a little bit here.  The defense argument goes like this: it seems that a truthful reconstruction of the first sentence in the OP is something along the lines of ""the president's decision to allow U.S. funds to be potentially used to pay for abortion outside this country.""  If the above is an accurate statement whereas the original claim is not accurate, then the major distinction is that Obama is not intentionally providing funds for foreign abortions, though he is allowing funds to be provided for those foreign abortions.  That seems like more Half-Truth territory than total falsehood, IF it can be shown that NGOs have been using funds under the Obama administration to fund abortive services."
463,"Can you be more specific? I've noticed vague questions in this SR tend to get less answers as you are asking a very wide scope of research. Maybe ask your boss what bill or act the president was involved in that led to less loans? Then you can re-frame your question with ""Did x bill or y act cause commercial/personal loans to be reduced?"". Even then though there are a lot of factors... we could tell you ""Yes after that law was passed there was less, same, or more loans"" but to say just that one thing caused it without a lot of evidence backing it up is unlikely as our loan system is very large and very complex. The best you could hope for is a ""Mostly true"" or ""Mostly false"" but likely at the end of the day you can take the numbers and draw any conclusion you would like to.I also agree that ""causation"" may be impossible to verify. But since this was a very clear open question to the Reddit community overall, I felt we could see what light we could bring to it in any case."
464,"This is a prediction.  You can't fact check predictions.  Did they provide any evidence for this prediction?  It's probably 'one economist working for a right leaning think tank estimates...'It's a bit of ""crystal ball"" forecasting that depends on the viewer.  Medicare costs are rising.  Most all say the costs are rising too high & too fast.  The challenge becomes how to lower or slow the increase.  The Democrat/Obama plan is to use the government to push for greater efficiencies by weeding out bad programs, policing for corruption, and limiting the amount that certain companies can spend on things other than patient directed services.  The Republican/Romney plan is to use the market to push for greater efficiencies by allowing private companies to compete with each other is a less regulated world, where the sick elderly citizen uses their power as a consumer to pick winners and losers.  The problem with the Romney plan is the same problem with his tax plan. With his tax plan, he gives immediate tax relief to millionaires and explains that he will make up for that revenue loss by closing loopholes, loopholes that he is not specific about but promises to tell us about later, after he is elected.Under the Romney Medicare plan, costs go down immediately because they are capped for anyone 55 or younger.  Romney assumes that once it's capped, the ""consumers"" will use there market pressures to lower the costs, something that is not done in the Obama plan.   In short, the savings come ""later, trust me"". Under the Romney plan, when a 68 year old woman is diagnosed with bladder cancer, she will ""shop around"" and make an educated consumer choice for her treatment.  There will be several private companies interested in her business, so they will court her as a customer and offer her deals to gain her business, much in the same way that local carpet companies competed for her business when she was thinking about new carpeting for the dining room. This market competition will hold prices down.  If you're like me, you will not believe that the 68 year old woman will have the skills, state of mind, or time to shop around as if she was looking for a new coffee maker.  You will know that she is ill, scared, and will do all she can to get well.  So, she takes her ""voucher"" to the local hospital as partial payment for the services she needs.  Since the rising costs of medical care will most likely rise faster than her Medicare voucher, she will make up the difference out of her savings.  So, I would say the statement is truthful.  EDIT:  [Cutler's Democratic affiliations make him vulnerable to accusations of partisanship. But much of his data is drawn from studies by the independent Congressional Budget Office, **which has projected even higher costs to future retirees under a 2011 budget plan written by Ryan**, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee.The budget agency said future retirees would pay more under Ryan's plan than if they went into traditional Medicare. By 2030, a typical 65-year-old would be paying two-thirds of his or her health costs, the agency said.](http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019100459_apuspresidentialcampaign.html)[Here](http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/healthcare/report/2012/08/24/33915/increased-costs-during-retirement-under-the-romney-ryan-medicare-plan/) is the paper by Cutler.[deleted]Thanks everybody for the research here, these can be murky topics at best. What do folks here think?  Sounds to me like ""Mostly True."" Unless I hear people think otherwise, will mark it as such later tonight.Those numbers do not appear in the article. Also, the question you pose is unclear. Do you mean an increase in benefits paid or an increase in costs?The consensus from the research thus far seems to be that this one is ""mostly true"" so marking it as such."
465,"Somewhat. On the first count, slashing the DoD budget, it goes with the policy of strategic realignment toward Pacific, ending multiple front hostilities, and, of course, actually lessening the dollars spent on defense. Slashing is a subjective term because we'll still spend a great deal more on defense than Russia, China, or Iran, a fact made even more uncontroversial considering how vastly superior our standing military capabilities are than theirs. On nukes, technically it's true. But the devil is in the details. The main thing to know is that the United States and China have two very different nuclear force structures. The US has the triad of bombers, ICBMs in silos, and sub launched SLBMs (hey guess what the SL stands for?). We deploy them around the world, provide a security blanket for a whole host of nations, and we do so with thousands of warheads. China primarily employs TEL launchers that are very mobile and standard silo-based ICBMs (and some LACMs for low payload stuff). However they have something like 250 warheads on maybe 300 TOTAL delivery systems but their ICBMs would barely crack 80. They have a lot more platforms geared for a localized defensive strike rather than nuking fools half way around the world (although they definitely retain the capability, albeit a comparatively small one). The real implication of the film's claim is ""does this make America less safe or diminish its defensive (or offensive) posture?"" I would say no. We still have the most robust nuclear arsenal on the planet even after downsizing. We still deploy the most sophisticated subsurface fleet in operation. Between our bomber fleet, BM units, and subs, no one is going to say ""hey this Obama guy is really dumb lets nuke the shit out of America."" Really, not going to happen. There's also a fundamental misunderstanding of how nuclear weapons are deployed and thought of. They aren't tactical weapons that we maintain to use. It's the break glass in case of stupid trump card that has prevented great power war since 1946. We maintain them to keep others from using them, just as others maintain them to prevent us from using them. There's some debate over how well MAD works and I think a lot of it is well founded, but for the time being the regime in place works sufficiently.  And downsizing isn't just some hippie wet dream policy, but it makes fiscal sense when dollars are on the block for DoD. MDA takes up a lot of money to keep running and AFGSC does that and ties up aircraft. When your deterrent force is OVER the necessary level for the current state of affairs, it makes sense to shut some of it down, particularly when the cons of doing so are very very small. Obama has stated a desire to get to ""global zero,"" which is exactly what is sounds like--zero nuclear weapons. I think it is foolish to completely get rid of them, but reducing stock piles when your chief THEORETICAL opponents still lag behind in either number of warheads (China) or reliable delivery systems (Russia...seriously, their shit is a joke these days) seems reasonable. The implied charge that this will hurt America's defense and is fueled by some dislike of America is complete rubbish, and the above claim aims to score cheap visceral reaction points on the relative ignorance of the general population on a topic like this.On modernizing and budgeting of the US Nuclear arsenal, some claims here worth checking on sourcing and accuracy:http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-mislead-on-obamas-nuclear-spending/2012/08/31/f0ec910a-f2e7-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89_story.htmlThe consesus seems to be false.  The START treaty that predated Obama caused the largest downtick in nuclear arsenals, and we verified that Obama has been actively upgrading the existing network. And other than cost savings as two wars are ended, we have not seen DOD cuts to warrant the claim. This film is misinforming it audience on these points.It would appear the basis for these claims comes strongly from here:http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/obamas-plan-for-u-s-arsenal-unsealed-in-charlotte/A book called Fool Me Twice.The START treaty has already reduced the stockpile to a few thousand. Future reductions would appear the be hear-say at this point. Anyone have stats on China's arsenal?I think this assertion can be shown to be False or Mostly False just with these numbers on numbers from mccdizzile showing a reduction but not a ""slash"" which is a blurry term but could fairly be seen as a dramatic or major cut in military budget support. Which aside from the drawdown in Iraq, we don't see.  Then on nuclear - the link i found showed strong evidence for upgrading, modernizing and budgeting for the us Nuclear arsenal. So unless folks have any new data, I say this one earned at least Mostly False.The film has been pretty thoroughly fact checked already.  Most everything in the film is false, or taken completely out of context and warped to fit the film-makers schizophrenic worldview.   http://www.businessinsider.com/obamas-america-2016-2012-9Just my opinion here, but first of all, I wouldn't believe anything from the film 2016 and secondly, even a few hundred nukes could destroy the  earth several times over. De we really need more?lol at ""as _low_ as a few hundred [nuclear] missiles.""It's also worth noting that we have powerful allies such as great Britain that would assist us if we were invaded."
466,"[Directly from the Census Bureau:](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/employment_occupations/cb10-53.html)> In the third quarter of 2008, approximately 45 percent of U.S. residents lived in households in which at least one individual received government benefits, according to data released today by the U.S. Census Bureau. These benefits came from programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.Notice it says 45% of residents live in a household in which a person in that household received benefits; NOT 45% of households. For example, you could have a family of five in which 1 person receives benefits, but all five people would be counted in that 45%, even thought it's only one household.More embarrassing is that in the following paragraph it says the number of HOUSEHOLDS receiving benefits is 24%:>According to the report, about 28.4 million households, or 24 percent of the U.S. total, received means-tested benefitsThe claim that nearly half of U.S. households receives benefits is **FALSE.**More data here - http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/just-how-many-households-receive-government-benefits/2011/10/05/gIQAphrCOL_blog.html"

According to his boss who hired him as a community organizer, Barack might have been making as much as $35,000 a year after several years.  $35,000 was enough, in 1992, to afford shoes and a decent car, but we don't know what Barack did with his money, or if he worked full time.  Maybe he was helping his mother financially, as she worked on her Ph.D.  Maybe he gave most of his money to charity or helped the poor people he worked with.The point is this:  Not only is this information irrelevant, but to prove Barack Obama had a limited income, you would have to have his tax returns for 1985 to 1992.  Hey, while we are at it, why not get Mitt Romney's for the same period.If you are going to check facts, make them useful and important.  I know the folks on the right like to say that Barack Obama was one of those rich community organizers who teach black people to commit voter fraud, but this forum should be better than that."

Changing this one out.Over at the WashPo Wonk blog, they say this about claim: ""True... According to the CBO, the Obama budget reduces the deficit relative to current policy from $10.9 trillion over ten years to $6.3 trillion, a reduction of $4.6 trillion.

476,"I think it should be standard practice to avoid making any conclusions based on news articles, opinion or otherwise, and quotes.instead we should try to focus on numbers/data, definitions, experiments, and mathematical models for our conclusions. Lets streamline this process to be as scientific as possible.Would there be any benefit to people posting a ""fact"" that they'd like to have ""checked"" and then letting the rest of community have at it?Rather than posting a ""fact"" and then immediately post your own opinions of whether's it's true as breadworshipper did in his post about Sandra Fluke?What is the policy regarding (upvoted/top) comments that are incorrect, irrelevant, or improperly sourced?  Can the mods edit the OP with a link to the correct comment? Reddit's voting system tends to favor earlier comments, so a correct comment that comes in late may remain unseen. Personally I'm against the politifact rating system. It's inherently subjective and susceptible to bias. That's why I prefer factcheck.org, they just post the claim and their own analysis. Shouldn't a fact only be true, false, or unverifiable? Personally, I'd like to see a moderation style closer to /r/askscience than /r/atheism. I think this sub has great potential, it's just the reddit voting system that concerns me. Just my two cents. Thanks for taking the time for setting this up. I'll make an effort to be a regular contributor.I have to say, the mods seem to be doing a great job so far.   I've had some questions about what should and should not be fair game here, and they've answered my questions thoroughly, and the ratings I've looked at so far seem fair.How about a definition of what a fact is. I asked for the thesis of an article stating ""the deficit was a good investment"" to be vetted and instead it was deleted for being an ""opinion.""

If there's something you'd like to see improved or changed, please don't hesitate to ask. Myself and the other mods want the integrity of this subreddit to be above everything else.I have to say, the way up/downvotes are being handled here are pretty disappointing so far.  Not really a mod issue, I suppose, but more of a community one - it's already getting the /r/politics feel, and that's not a good sign.> Third, please remember this is not /r/politics[1] . This is a fact-finding subreddit. We are not here to debate policies or beliefs, but to discuss the immediate validity of a posted statement. Pretty much every post in a discussion should be a fact-based reference complete with citations or explanation of data. We will not tolerate opinion debates and they will be deleted accordingly. I would like to see the mods take a closer look at what constitutes a ""political debate.""  Too often so far, I've seen debates about what certain facts are about get threatened, if not outright deleted, because of the belief by one mod that it's a ""political debate.""  I understand the need to stay focused, but not at the expense of fact-finding."
477,"I am not sure it makes sense to insist on a deadline between the post ""we're going to change the flair"" and the actual change of the flair.  Here is my reasoning:The fact-flair is not final anyway.  It reflects the conclusion that the contributors' fact-based research appears to support.  If contradicting evidence is presented, of course it would be integrated into the flair (though, in all likelihood, people would stop having as much interest in the thread after the flair is changed).Because the needs and interest in each fact-check are likely to be different, I think it makes the most sense to leave the decision up to the individual mod and their own schedules on the lag-time between the announcement and the flair change.  Mods are people too, and I'd rather not set-in-stone policies that don't need to be set in stone--particularly when the cost is having to do something in the community while you're out living your life doing whatever it is you do.  That sort of high burden leads to a high risk of burn out.I think the flair can only be decided whenever a mod feels it's right.  The community will let you guys know if you're doing it wrong I'm sure.  Defending controversial decisions effectively will be what sinks or sails this subreddit.It would be neat if the flair could reflect changes in decisions, for example adding a second flair as opposed to replacing original decisions.    Being able to see the direction of an argument could be valuable.I do like the real world advice here about not being too strucutred. Sounds wise.I don't like the timed deadline. I could see, whatever the deadline being, a mod posting ""we are going to mark this <rating> in X hours"" and somebody coming along in X+1 hours to complain. My real fear is a rogue mod. While I think the mods have done just fine so far, if one develops a partisan bent and starts marking posts True or False based on their opinion it would kill the credibility of this subreddit. I think a better criteria would be ""once more than half of the mods agree it's decided"" or if that is too strict ""at least 2 mods agree"". I would also set some criteria for what counts as a source. A link to factcheck or politifact is going to make us look like shills. A direct link to an official report or transcript? Makes us look like we're doing our job. (I admit I am not exactly innocent in this manner).I would also like a time limit on threads - I realize this is probably my most controversial idea. I just feel like it looks bad on the subreddit to have 3 day old threads with dozens of posts and it's still 'Please Verify'. I feel that at some point the mods need to flair or get off the pot. If debate is still raging after 36 hours I would just punt and call it unverifiable or have new flair that says ""no concensus"".Can you also have a **Disputed** flair? It might be that the critical mass divides. And actually thinking about it a **Unresolvable** might also be also be good. That is, we may decide that the question is a question that can't be resolved at all.I'm not a fan of the Confirmed Fact flair. Politics relies heavily on speculation. I think the strongest you should rate something is mostly true or mostly false."
478,"I'm seeing a lot of argument in here about intent, meaning, etc. This subreddit is designed to do one thing, take a claim and verify it's validity. We are not here to assume or discuss intent.**The question posed was: was the statement by Ms. Fluke accurate? Was she shut out of a hearing that discussed contraception, and were there indeed no women testifying at the hearing?**Ms. Fluke was indeed barred from a hearing, I don't think anyone here denies this. This point of contention in this thread seems to be the topic of discussion at said hearing.Let's look at the source and ignore the media for a moment (but acknowledging this too has a bias):http://oversight.house.gov/hearing/lines-crossed-separation-of-church-and-state-has-the-obama-administration-trampled-on-freedom-of-religion-and-freedom-of-conscience/The [transcript](http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/02-16-12-Full-Committee-Hearing-Transcript.pdf) for the hearing states the purpose of the meaning is to discuss the role of religious freedom as it related to a portion of the health care mandate. The opening statement reads as such:""*As the son of two Pentecostal ministers from a small church in Baltimore, I understand the position of the religious community on this issue. I know both through my faith and my legal training that we have an obligation as a Nation to make accommodations when appropriate to avoid undue interference with the practice of religion. But there is another core interest we must consider, and that is the interest of women. The pill has a profound impact on their well-being, far more than any man in this room can possibly know. It has allowed women to control their lives and make very personal decisions about how many children to have and when to have them.*""**Up front we see that religion and contraception are the primary motivations of discussion - though this is denied by Chairman Issa.***Mrs. MALONEY. Ms. Fluke is a student at a well-respected Catholic university. She is affected by these policies. Why in the worldis she not qualified?Chairman ISSA. I appreciate the gentlelady’s question. We are not having a hearing on the policies or the details related to the single issue of ObamaCare and this particular mandate. This hearing is about religious freedom. As you will note, the men that you have noted on the panel come from denominations other than Roman Catholic. They are, in fact, here to speak about a broad question.***The second question is, were there women present?** From the transcript, it appears the answer is yes, as one of the first people to speak is a women. ~~It is important to understand a distinction, however - that no women were on the panel, the only women present being Representatives.~~ Ms. Fluke was denied the opportunity to testify.*""What I want to know is where are the women? When I look at this panel, I don’t see one single woman representing the tens of millions of women across the country who want and need insurance coverage for basic preventive health care services, including family planning. Where are the women?"" - Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney*It's important to note that while women were present (the two Reps, who later left in protest), none testified.**The third question is were they debating an issue that affects every woman?** If we're being intellectually honest, the answer is yes. However you view the aim/goals of the hearing, they unarguably centered on women's health/contraception. Further, coming from another angle - that of religion, this too would affect almost, if not all, women. Regardless of the original intent of the meeting, the discussion and conclusions drawn from the meaning surrounded that of women's health.**I would rate Ms. Fluke's claims as ~~technically true~~ **false**, ~~but with the acknowledgement it's important to look at context when considering the efficacy of her statement~~.** Ms. Fluke was shut out of a hearing. ~~The panel, did indeed, not hear from a single women via testimony.~~ The panel heard from two women.

The numbers are sound, however it cannot be ignored that a President, or even all of Congress is not solely responsible for creating private sector jobs. It can only foster conditions. I would have rated this entirely true if Clinton had not assigned a jobs score, but by doing so is attributing jobs to the parties and not simply saying they were created while those parties were in power.Those numbers are accurate.

A half of hour of Googling around got me no where.This seems like a good place to start:http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0500000001?output_view=net_1mthThis is another of those unverifiable questions.The first problem is that regulatory and tax changes take a while to work through the economy.  The time for that to happen varies based on dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of variables.   If a change occurs 1 year before the end of president X, and a year later President Y is in charge and employment goes up, does President Y get credit, or President X?Even if you could solve that problem definitively, you still have a second problem: the confounding issue of who is in charge of Congress.   If D's are in charge of one branch and the R's the other, who gets credit for the job growth?  These two factors make the question unverifiable.   Any claim otherwise is partisan cheerleading.There is a more general test you can do: look at the growth of government by various measures, and economic performance over the next 1, 3, and 5 years.   Then look at which party supported that growth and which opposed it (it's not always the same).I did a rough test of (the first half of) this about six months ago, and it looked pretty clear except for the years during WWII.   I couldn't decide if it is fair to dismiss those years or not, so I gave up on the project.I used http://data.bls.gov/pdq/querytool.jsp?survey=ce, 'All Employed, All Private, seasonally adjusted', inauguration month to inauguration month.  I came up with 41M while Dem was POTUS, 23M while Rep was POTUS.  The statement is completely true but is it a valid measurement?  Does it matter?  If you think it doesn't matter then don't blame Obama for the unemployment rate.  For job creation either it matters which party holds the White House or it doesn't.  We have to decide what matters, how to calculate it and then run the numbers.Most the job created where during the internet boom (1995-2000), that burst little before Bush took office.What jobs did they create? Government jobs?Government doesnt make jobs. They dont wave a wand and poof, jobs appear. I question BOTH statistics. Did they tell Ford ""you better hire!"" then go ""look what we did!"""

The debt that is listed in their first presidential year is their inherited debt. Any sharp increases in their first year are due to existing debt, and debt that is added by any deficit. As all budgets of their first year were passed the year earlier, by the previous administration. For Example. In 1980 (When Reagan was elected but not inaugurated) the debt was $907 Billion. The extra $97 Billion of debt in his first year of office is because of the budget that the Carter administration signed into law. Same situation for Barack Obama. The additional $1.9 Trillion of Debt in his first year was because of the budget signed by the Bush administration in his last year of office, added with the $700 Billion dollars added to our deficit when Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that the Bush administration signed into law.Again. To reiterate. The debt of a president's first year is their inherited debt regardless of their policies.The confounding point is that Congress passes the budget, so who was in charge of congress matters. But since the President has the ultimate yes/no say, I think it's fair to assign the debt to the president, so I'll give him this one.**Under Reagan / GH Bush - 1981-1992:**Total US Debt in 1981 - $1,028,729,000,000Total US Debt in 1992 - $4,177,009,000,000$4,177,009,000,000 / $1,028,729,000,000 = **4.06****Under GW Bush 2000-2008**Total US Debt in 2000: $5,943,438,563,436Total US Debt in 2008: $10,699,804,864,612$10,699,804,864,612 / $5,943,438,563,436 = **1.8**For comparison:**Under Clinton 1992-2000**$5,662,216,013,697 / $4,535,687,054,406 = **1.24****Under Obama 2008-Present**$15,856,367,214,324 / $12,311,349,677,512 = **1.28**Source:http://www.skymachines.com/US-National-Debt-Per-Capita-Percent-of-GDP-and-by-Presidental-Term.htmAny economists want to account for inflation as well?

So his position has not been ""ultimately what the President did"" or that what Obama did was ""exactly as I proposed.""His view was that the companies should go through managed bankruptcy.  This is true:> The American auto industry is vital to our national interest as an employer and as a hub for manufacturing. A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs.

493,"Here's the key problem:> America's top economic forecasters -- Macroeconomic Advisers, Moody's Economy.com, IHS Global Insight, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and the Congressional Budget Office -- agree that it increased GDP at least 2 percentage points, the difference between contraction and growth, and saved or created about 2.5 million jobs.As noted in an earlier thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/zaumm/is_this_article_from_forbes_correct_that_obama_is/c632xeg?context=3) the CBO - and the other groups listed, for that matter - are only using input projections, not a raw count.  *Of course* the models suggest X growth and Y jobs - that's how it was justified to start!  Of course their models are going to show an increase of what they said.  But it's not a real, objective, physical finding, it's all projections.It's worth noting that the WaPo study of studies relies on many of the same forecasters (Moodys, CBO) that the quoted part does.As long as we're relying on multipliers and not real-world indicators, it's probable that we're never going to know for sure if the stimulus worked or not.  Given that we're at over 8% unemployment and growth is anemic, it's clear that the stimulus itself was fairly oversold and a failure in that it did not do what it was advertised to do.  Given the lack of real world information, though, it's all speculation.There are two problems with the statement ""the stimulus worked"" - 1. The financial collapse was worse than anyone predicted and than the media and government reported.  Who actually covered this up--the government or the financial institutions, I don't personally know.  Probably a combination of the two.  The amount of money the Fed poured into the economy (around $7 trillion), dwarves the stimulus and also makes it pretty much impossible for anyone to say whether it worked or not.  In comparison to the EU, something we did seemed to work, as our recover, while slow, has been better.  However, that's still just speculation because there are too many factors involved.  Which leads to:2. It's pretty much impossible to say what works and what doesn't in highly complex, multi-variable situations because there in life, there's no control group.  We don't know what would have happened had we done nothing.  Experts can speculate one way or the other, but they pretty much just speculating.  Political parties are going to say whatever makes them look best.This has been voted up, so it clearly has interest, but does any one care to critique the numbers listed? Are there weak points to this argument factually? Or other supporting evidence from other sources too?If you have a theory that makes a specific, testable prediction, and that prediction fails to come true, then the theory behind it is false.   If the prediction comes true, then that hypothesis is supported.The Obama administration had the theory that government spending money helps the economy (the theory).   They made a specific prediction: if the 'stimulus' passed, unemployment would stay below 8%.Non-Democratic economists had a theory that wasteful government spending harms the economy, and that if the stimulus passed unemployment would *increase*, far beyond the levels predicted by the Obama administration.In this real world test, the specific testable claim of the Obama administration has failed, therefore the only rational conclusion is that the theory that government spending helps the economy is false.   The other side made a different prediction that came true -- therefore that hypothesis is supported.Any other claim is pseudo-science - just after-the-fact justifications that make the original Obama hypothesis unfalsifiable."
494,"Depends on whether you're separating out mandatory and discretionary spending or not.If you're putting all the spending together (which makes sense), social spending (driven by Medicare and Social Security) takes up over half.  Defense spending (including war spending, not including Homeland Security, I believe) hits roughly half of discretionary spending.Here's an interesting look at how it breaks down:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/50-years-of-government-spending-in-one-graph/2012/05/16/gIQAFaloTU_blog.htmltl;dr: entitlement spending is the key driver of spending overall, but defense drives discretionary spending.Wikipedia says it's getting its [financial numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_federal_budget) from the federal governmentEnacted amounts for the fiscal year 2012:- National Defense - $716.300 billion- Health - $361.625 billion- Medicare - $484.486 billion- Income Security - $579.578 billion- Social Security - $778.574 billionThe United States federal government spends more on Social Security alone than on defense.When you add in the other social services, the United States federal government spends over 2 trillion dollars a year out of a 3.6 trillion dollar budget on social services."

So, it's sort of true.  The problem is a new president comes in a third of the way through a fiscal year.  If you look at the fiscal year that started up during Bush and ended during Obama's first year, spending went skyrocketing.  Some of the things Bush did, are now getting credited to Obama.  That being said, the largest increase is Bush's final year, in a crisis, so it skews the comparison,And here is a rebuttal from a Conservative Think Tank: http://blog.heritage.org/2012/05/24/setting-obamas-great-fiscal-restraint-record-straight/  Would be good to evaluate both arguments here.No. It's not. He merely did not increase the budget as much as others. This doesn't mean he's the smallest spender. If Bob kills 10 people, his son kills 15, and his grandson kills 16 it doesn't mean that the grandson is a smaller killer than the son. It means he increased his killing less than the predecessor, but he still carried over the killing from the original Bob.Edit: Note, I am not a Romney supporter. I just think that labeling Obama as a small spender is somewhat misleading. Do note, also, that labeling most Republican presidents as small spenders is also misleading.

I'll look over things some later (tomorrow) to chime in.One thing from the Politifact article, although they say this claim is ""mostly true"" they do a good job of listing the reasoning they see in critics: ""The most common criticism focuses on how to divvy up the responsibility for outlays made in fiscal year 2009. Should those outlays be counted on George W. Bush’s balance sheet or Obama’s?Nutting’s method was to assign spending for the first fiscal year following a president’s inauguration to the preceding president. In his column, Nutting argued that ""what people forget (or never knew) is that the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and Congress. The president only begins to shape the budget in his second year. It takes time to develop a budget and steer it through Congress — especially in these days of congressional gridlock. The 2009 fiscal year, which Republicans count as part of Obama’s legacy, began four months before Obama moved into the White House. The major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress.""The critics countered that the transition between Bush and Obama, which came amid a severe economic downturn, did not fit the historical pattern. While Nutting tried to account for this by re-assigning $140 billion of fiscal 2009 spending from Bush to Obama -- specifically the stimulus bill, the expansion of a children’s health-care program and other appropriations bills passed in the spring of 2009 -- the critics say that that’s not enough.And because spending spiked dramatically in the crucial period between 2008 and 2009, figuring out where exactly to draw the line between the two presidents has an enormous impact on the results of any analysis of federal spending.""And here is the other Politifact original analysis:http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/23/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-says-barack-obama-has-lowest-s/"
499,"Even if this were true, the claim is not that 30,000 *votes* were found from dead people.  The claim is that, administratively, the voter roles are not up to date with death certificates.  Frankly, even if true, this is simply an administrative problem, kinda like needing to run a big spell check.Of course dead people are on voter rolls. Most people die without first taking themself off of the rolls.If this said 30k dead voters voted, then it would be news.Since they haven't released their research publicly, there's no way to verify it.  The NC Board of Elections might release a comment on it, or we could wait to FOIA their submission.NOTE: do want to focus the discussion here to verifying the facts of this story rather than discussing the wisdom, fairness or Constitutionality of Voter ID requirements. Plenty in this story to check just on checking facts alone. (Thought we aren't helped by the lack of public actual data yet.)Here's some indication... >Earlier this summer, the organization sued to have 528 Wake County residents it claimed were not U.S. citizens removed from the voter registration. The county elections board investigated the complaint and found that all of the voters were citizens and eligible to vote.[source](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/09/02/3497857/group-says-it-found-30000-dead.html)That said, it's entirely possible that there are that many dead voters who haven't been purged from the voter rolls because there are over 6,300,000 voters in NC.   30,000 is a very small percentage of the total....   but remember that Obama won NC by less than 20,000 votes in '08.This is one of those things that may well be true but mislead anyway. NC has [9.6 million people](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/37000.html). 3/4 of them (same source) are over 18, call that 7 million potential voters. I would have said 3/4th are registered, but NC says they have [6.2M registered voters](http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/36596/85942/en/summary.html). Let us call it 6M.So let's do a  quick dirty analysis. Assume an average age of 80. That roughly means that 1/80th (1.25%) of the population dies each year. (It is more complex but not relevant since people die more on the extremes so for the dirty analysis it averages out). 1.25% of 6,000,000 is 75,000. So over a year we *expect* 75,000 registered voters in NC to die. Having *only* 30,000 dead voters means that NC is doing a *very good job* in cleaning out their DB. So good in fact that I am quite surprised at how *low* that figure is.People die every day and the clerks in each town may not keep up with removing them from the voter rolls.  What the conservatives want you to read here is that 30,000 dead people are actually voting, which is not true.Here is the only other non-Voter Integrity Project press I can find on this so far. Not much new that isn't from the original press release. http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/09/02/3497857/group-says-it-found-30000-dead.html"
500,"I guess it depends on your opinion of Snopes, but [here](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/loans.asp) is their analysis. * The accusation is false* The lawsuit claimed that Citibank was rejecting loans to minority applicants while approving loans to white applicants with a similar financial characteristics* It had nothing to do with lending to individuals who were not capable of paying back their loans* Obama was not the lead lawyer*source: Snopes.com*The Snopes article cites clearinghouse.com, which is funded by the National Science Foundation, the Chicago Sun Times, and the Associated Press. Looking solely at the sources of each version of the story I'd be inclined the say that the Snopes rendition is true and the versions you are finding are blatantly false. While I do believe that the default rate of those involved in the class action lawsuit was true, it was most likely an unintended consequence of the lawsuit.I'm finding tons of other conservative political blogs covering this but very few that aren't just repeating the DC story. Not finding much about the actual original lawsuit yet...Also curious if ""higher than normal"" as described in the article is verifiable for the zip codes in question. Also the article claims to specifically check the plaintiffs if i read it correctly -- versus just looking at how the lawsuit effected the zip codes in the case, no? Why would it be relevant the effect on the individuals filing the complaint rather than looking at the effect of the settlement itself overall?I recognize that this article covers a lot of ground. And on it's face it does not reference a great deal of specific sourcing. But it seems that some or much of this should be verifiable.Government incentives to financial institutions to make subprime loans started in 1995, and didn't really have much to do with Obama."

That would have been a tough one to answer.I'm about to label this as ""False"" unless there is any objections, Debbie seems to have clearly misrepresented the LA Times article and overstates Romney's involvement in the GOP platform language.The verdict is correct here to the research we found i think. but it is confusing based on the title. But it might be clearer to say that Schultz comments are confirmed as false, so i think FALSE fact-flair might be more helpful."
502,"This article would claim that the Dems only had a ""super-majority"" enough to overcome a fillibuster for 24 days. Can someone vet his argument?  http://factleft.com/2012/01/31/the-myth-of-democratic-super-majority/It depends on what you mean. There were never 60 democrats in the Senate. There were 58 Democrats plus [Sanders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders) (a socialist) and [Lieberman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lieberman) (an independent) both of whom caucus with the Democrats. Lieberman was anything but a reliable vote and could not be made to vote by calling it a party vote. So Obama never had an actual filibuster-proof majority. Unfortunately the media missed that rather critical difference and did call it a 60 vote majority.edit: added the links since this seems to be a reality based community.And first item, in the Senate to overcome a fillibuster you need 60 votes.

Some things they didn't really try though (like a budget, choosing the stick with the same one Obama condemned during his campaign).I'm about to add this post flair as a ""False"" unless there is any serious objection.

505,"According the CIA world factbook there are 47 countries with lower maternal mortality rate than US: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.htmlAnd US does use the most money on healthcare: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capitaAdditionally according to amnesty induction and cesarean don't seem to be the causes.

It is summed up in the one politifact review:""But a review of Obama’s foreign travels and remarks during his early presidency showed no evidence to support such a blunt and disparaging claim. (In later years, we found two formal apologies, but they were not at the start of his presidency and not part of a tour.)While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, he typically combined those passages with praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries had erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch.Calling those remarks ""an apology tour"" is a ridiculous charge. So we rate his statement Pants on Fire.""I think the ""apology tour"" thing was more rhetoric than an actual tour. But, thanks to the Free Beacon, [video of 5 times Obama apologized for America.](http://freebeacon.com/five-times-obama-has-apologized-for-america/)I'd call it more of a Mending Broken Fences tour...This is not accurate. Romney will not start his presidency with a jobs tour. Starting on day 1, he will act to repeal Obamacare.Starting on day 1, he will do everything in his power to end these days of drift and disappointment.On day 1, he will focus on rebuilding America's economy.On Day 1, he will reinstate the Mexico City policy. He will cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund, which supports China’s barbaric One Child Policy. He will ensure that organizations like Planned Parenthood get no federal support. And he will reverse every single Obama regulation that attacks our religious liberty and threatens innocent life.Then, he'll do a jobs tour.This link has a collection of every ""I will"" statement that Romney has made in his campaign speeches and at the RNC. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/30/us/politics/romney-i-will.html"
507,"The quote is ""Fact checkers come to this with their own sets of thoughts and beliefs, and we’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers""The second part is just Obama reinterpreting and paraphrasing.Washington post has Obama's quote here. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/08/29/obama-jabs-romney-camp-on-truthfulness/“Somebody was challenging one of their ads,” Obama said. “They just they made it up about work and welfare. And every outlet said this was just not true. They were asked about it, and a campaign person said, we won’t have the fact checkers dictate our campaign plan. We will not let the truth get in the way.”Kind of fuzzy - it could be argued that he was paraphrasing what they said - in oral context, intonation could make a difference. But it could also be interpreted to be included in the ""a campaign person said"" direct quote. I would argue this is a pretty typical political tact of interpreting the other candidate's intentions based on what's been said. Very closely placed to the quote, but still not intended to be part of the quote.The tweet by RedState is a redirection, rather than an honest request for fact checking.It depends on whether the second line was intended to be a part of the quoted first line (which matches) or commentary on it. I'm not sure that's resolvable in oratory as there's no visible quote marks.Any way this can get voted to the front of r/politics? Would love to see accountability of ALL candidates when it comes to out of context quotes.So i THINK we have found here that we should call this one FALSE, as Obama was not clearly making the entire statement as one direct quote. Do folks agree?"
508,"You're going to go crazy fact checking the DailyCaller.That audit lists the IT Internship Program as spending $2m over the FY 2010 and 2011.

Trying to use interns for IT security was probably misguided from the beginning, regardless of how much money was spent.Think i found the link here: http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/88401-0001-12.pdfThe article sources to ""a recent audit of the USDA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer"" but that link is broken, thus making it hard to tell.

509,"The GOP 2012 Party platform does include this:""Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.

Can others find more specific commentary if this by definition would exclude IVF treatments?And here, the GOP co-chair clarifies that they don't say in their platform exactly which ""Human life amendment"" they are referring to, and that they don't take a position on any possible amendment with some potential exemptions to a full and complete ban: ""The Republican Party plank endorsing a Human Life Amendment does not take a position on which version of a Human Life Amendment should eventually be adopted,"" James Bopp, the co-chairman of the party platform's Subcommittee on Restoring Constitutional Government, emailed to The Hill.

I can think of only two other cases in which the government has any say over an individuals body: drug use and capital punishment. Both of which are issues of criminality by which an individual has forfeit his rights through his actions. If republicans pass this amendmendment it will be the first time the government has taken civil rights away from a demographic. By allowing this policy to pass, assuming the supreme court doesn't blow a gasket, the government will create the only real precedence for the repeal or denial of civil liberties. The ramifications of this policy are far more severe than people are aware."

515,"No truth. Unfortunately, he's making insane claims, so there aren't legitimate sources reporting ""This crazy dude is crazy."" However, some google-fu turns up no legitimate sources which believe this will be a problem. He doesn't even cite a part of the bill to support this claim.It's also telling that he cites no sources, and the only part of the ACA he refers to (not even to support the claim you ask about) is one which says that there will be guidelines for basic treatment insurance should cover (which, incidentally, doesn't support his claim that one person appointed by Obama has sole authority over that, just a few pages earlier it says that there will be councils to do this, with an oversight process).The ACA lays out a baseline for what insurance policies are acceptable. If you don't have insurance or your policy doesn't meet that baseline (and if your income is above a certain amount) you have to pay a fee. You can still have that policy, you can still pay for medical treatment, you can still go to the ER. But you have to pay an additional fee on your taxes.Just look at his argument: The government uses medicaide to pressure doctors into catering to medicaide patients. The government can use the ACA to pressure doctors into catering to ACA approved policies. Therefore, if you don't have an ACA approved policy no doctor will see you.If his argument were true, anyone without medicaide would have been ""completely deprived"" of medical treatment since medicaide was established."

The 7+3+2 refers to the millions of jobs created by Romney's tax plan, energy policies and cracking down on copyright issues in China. > Specifically, I find that the reform would, if passed immediately, increase GDP relative to baseline by 5.4 percentage points **over the next decade**, while creating 6.8 million jobs.[Abstract of the tax review](http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/Diamond-RomneyTaxReformPlan-080312.pdf). The number's 6.8M and it's over the next decade.> The cumulative impact of new production, lower consumption and associated activity could increase GDP by 2%-3%, creating 2.7-3.6m net new jobs **by 2020**. [Energy policy](http://fa.smithbarney.com/public/projectfiles/ce1d2d99-c133-4343-8ad0-43aa1da63cc2.pdf). The WaPo fact check is correct that the paper doesn't review Romney's policies specifically, but we can temporarily work with the assumption Romney will do all of those for now (otherwise we'll get really bogged down).> TABLE ES.2  Summary of potential U.S. gains from IPR improvement in China (based on statistical and simulation analysis)> [snip]>  U.S. net employment effect (in FTEs) 2.1 million [Intellectual property rights improvement, no timeline given](http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4226.pdf).OK, so almost 7 + 3ish + 2 = 12. That's Romney's argument. WaPo and TheDailyBeast are correct that the timelines are all different and none of them are 4 years, so it's not ""12 million jobs created by 2016"".Now, here comes the caveat that requires the ""mostly true"" instead of ""confirmed"". Romney isn't really arguing that on his website, he's just implying it strongly.Here's the [Romney jobs page](http://www.mittromney.com/JobsPlan). Look what it says:> create 12 million jobs during his first termIf we accept the 7+3+2 math (which, honestly, I don't because they're not looking at his specific policies, but that's besides the point here), Romney will create 12 million jobs. And he will create them during his first term. However, the created jobs won't be filled until sometime before 2020. They'll have been created by his policies, enacted in his first term, but they won't materialize until later. That's his fig leaf.So, this specific claim? Mostly true. Employment will not increase by 12M in Romney's first term and the sources he used for 5M+ of those jobs did not examine his specific policies. However, there needs to be the attached caveat that Romney's wording on his website, which could be construed as his policies creating the environment to later create the jobs, is less specific than his off-the-cuff remarks and could justify his 12M/first term timeline.From Ezra Klien, looking at this:==One study said a Romney-like tax plan could create 7 million jobs. The only problem? That was over 10 years, not four years. Worse, the study assumed that a Romney-like tax plan would be completely paid for and would happen in an economy at full employment. Neither is likely. The next study was a Citigroup Global Markets effort that projected 3 million energy-related jobs. The only problems? It was over eight years, not four. Oh, and it wasn’t evaluating any of Romney’s policies at all. It was actually looking at current trends and policies — which is to say, Obama’s policies.Then there’s the 2 million jobs that a 2011 International Trade Commission report estimated we could create if China stopped violating our intellectual property rights. This study wasn’t looking at either Obama or Romney’s policies, and no one thinks that any U.S. president could get Chinese businesses to respect American patents.So Romney’s claim of 12 million jobs over four years breaks down to 7 million jobs over 10 years in an economy that’s already at full employment, 3 million jobs over eight years that have nothing to do with any of Romney’s policies, and 2 million jobs if China suddenly became very, very respectful of U.S. intellectual property laws. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/16/the-romney-campaigns-job-math-is-just-as-bad-as-its-tax-math/"

If we put this number in place of Lazorou's 106,000 drug errors and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) 98,000 medical errors, we could add another 216,000 deaths making a total of 999,936 deaths annually.http://www.ourcivilisation.com/medicine/usamed/deaths.htm> An average of 195,000 people in the USA died due to potentially preventable, in-hospital medical errors in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, according to a new study of 37 million patient records that was released today by HealthGrades, the healthcare quality company. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/11856.phpedit: Additionally, [this FBI data](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8) confirms that there were 323 murders by rifle in the US in 2011."
535,"for the people who don't feel like typing out the link since it's unclickable in a title and OP didn't include it in his post, [http://imgur.com/Cre4bxc](http://imgur.com/Cre4bxc)From 30 seconds of research, the assault weapons ban went into about 4 years before the Columbine massacre occurred.  Also, the ban only applied to weapons made after it went into place, so it's likely those weapons were made before the ban took effect.Would you like us to fact check your entire rant too? This isn't really the purpose of this subreddit..."
536,"um .. ""Other than ginning up black turnout for Obama's re-election effort in the crucial swing state of Florida""Obama cannot run for re-election. EDIT: and I'm being downvoted. That makes sense.As for number 2, Hispanic is not a race. You can be black hispanic, white hispanic, etc. See the intro here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HispanicUsing Brietbart as a fact-checking source?  Tsk.Not validating or invalidating anything per say, but fear of rape does not make someone a homophobe. I think they are reaching a bit far trying to turn the narrative that way.In number 7, > (which solidifies the Democrat base)is technically grammatically incorrect.*Democrat* is a noun. **Democratic** is an adjective. This has largely become popular in Republican circles as it is something of slight ""name calling"" that they can reasonably get away with.regarding number 1, it's still possible to do all that but have some internalized racism...well, like viewing some black kid he's never seen before walking around the neighborhood as suspicious.>BrietbartDisregard everything. Pay it no credence.>Obama's Justice Department Has Launched a National Fishing Expedition Against Zimmerman Probably because the reporting of such a frightening and Orwellian act of federal overreach might make look Zimmerman look sympathetic and hurt Obama, the media have apparently decided to ignore Attorney General Eric Holder's public witch hunt. The Justice Department is setting up a public tip line for Americans to ""help build a case against Zimmerman.""get help dude. seriouslyThe part about stand your ground really makes it. I never really thought he was racist,  just stupid.  In any case,  he should have headed the 911 operator's advice. End of story.My understanding of the case was the judge prevented the prosecution from bringing up race in their case yet allowed the defense to point out the crimes done by black males in the area to be the reason Zimmerman was concerned about Martin in the first place. So race WAS a factor in why Zimmerman paid attention to Martin, but that is different than Zimmerman being racist."
537,"There aren't really any facts to check here -- it's just a couple of anecdotes.I think you can dismiss this. It's a bunch of anecdotes, no facts at all. Plus, the guy's clearly a partisan with an agenda, so you can easily dismiss at least 90% of what he says.There isnt much hard information on any of the final affordability of the plans. For me personally, if I dropped my insurance through my company, I could get something cheaper, but not much. And it would be pretty much the same if I added my wife to the insurance from work, or if we were to get a plan on the exchange. I think the changes really depend on where you live. I think the next step in lowering costs, will be to allow insurance exchanges across state lines to really get competition going."
538,Supposedly based on what?No one will ever prove that no teacher assigned this homework based on something from common core...Someone on facebook posted it and I couldn't find a source....
539,This DOES NOT belong in this sub. Go rant about evil republicans on /r/politics.
