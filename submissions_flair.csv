Here’s what President Obama guaranteed back when he was on the campaign trail:>“Our conscience cannot rest so long as nearly 45 million Americans don't have health insurance and the millions more who do are going bankrupt trying to pay for it. I have made a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to $2,500 a year. That's not simply a matter of policy or ideology—it's a moral commitment.”>Both those promises have been broken too.>Far from covering every American, Obamacare has left 28 million uninsured.>28.2 Million Americans are uninsured under Obamacare>In fact, despite all the disruption and the billions in spending, as of February 2017 Obamacare’s exchanges cover just 10.3 million people. That’s less than half the number of Americans the Congressional Budget Office estimated back in 2012 would be enrolled.>Promises Made... 28.2 Million Promises Broken>And premiums didn’t go down by $2,500 for the average family—they went up by nearly $3,000!",9,36,3,None,33,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/06/30/remember-all-obamacares-broken-promises?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20170705_ADM_1600-Daily),",2017-07-05 23:08:44,

Or Fox News claim that something happened / was said, for which there is no record anywhere.  Or Fox News contradicts and earlier Fox News statement.

14,65azru,My friend is trying to convince me America is supposed to be the moral police of the world.,None,"He's trying to convince me (whether or not he likes it) that Trump is the leader of the free world, and the most powerful nation on Earth.  Thus, it should act as a moral police for other countries.  Thus, he justifies the firing of the Tomahawk missiles that killed 9 people because it's initial intentions was to stop Assad from firing more chemical bombs.  He also said that if you don't support that particular decision, it's the same as supporting the death of dozens of Syrians. Speaking retrospectively, it didn't work to stop any more chemical attacks and now Assad says it was fabricated, but apparently he doesn't think I should be allowed to speak retrospectively because you need to imagine the thought process of someone making a decision then and there. His only piece of historical evidence to justify American interference was WWII, claiming America was the reason it ended. He also justifies the collateral damage and war - that the death of a few people now is okay if it ensures the safety of the future.  I don't have a lot of knowledge on the issues (will research after exams) but despite being AGAINST American interference, I couldn't exactly offer up evidence to support my claims.  I decided to talk to another friend who has differing views on the issue.  He says that America has no right to act as a moral police and that none of its initiatives to interfere in other countries resulted in a positive impact on the world. (ex. Korean war, Vietnam)  It has no right to impose it's Western values on other countries.  And that it is no longer the super power it once was. Also with the case of WWII, it was the soviets that ended the war and America dropped the nuke on Japan after they were about the surrender.  I understand that in American history they say that the Japanese wouldn't have surrendered that easily and in Japanese history, they say that they were about to surrender and the nuke was a geopolitical effort to keep the soviet Union at bay.I was just wondering what are your opinions on what we spoke about?

To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school—who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.•  There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers. As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants. In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the number of hours worked by native-born teens (but not their employment levels).•  Some evidence on inflows of skilled immigrants suggests that there may be positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers, and other benefits to the economy more broadly.•  Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the United States.•   In  terms  of  fiscal  impacts,  first-generation  immigrants  are  more  costly  to  governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born, in large part due to the costs of educating their children. However, as adults, the  children  of  immigrants  (the  second  generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors  in  the  U.S.  population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population.•  Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government  budgets  are  generally  positive  at  the federal  level  but  remain  negative  at  the  state  and local  level—but  these generalizations  are  subject to a number of important assumptions. Immigration’s fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.",6,52,2,None,50,http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CNSTAT/Economic-and-Fiscal-Consequences-of-Immigration/index.htmI,2017-03-01 14:01:30,

Obstruction by Democrats!""Not the longest delay. Just one example: Loretta Lynch (Obama’s attorney general) waited 161 days to be confirmed after her nomination by the former president in 2015. When he said that, no secretary had more than 76 days waiting.

The press doesn’t tell it like it is.""

The rate has been in a declining trend since the 90s, and has effectively decline every year since 2006. 2015 was the first year that it went up, but still that rate was lower than any year between 1965 and 2009.2/6 Terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have ""gotten to a point where it's not even being reported, and in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it.""When asked, Trump and his administration were not able to point out a single case of a terrorist attack in US or Europe that was not reported. Even more, many cases of attacks that should not been considered “terrorist”, were reported as such2/6 “Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.

Because the responsibility of protecting the country while respecting the laws and the constitution is in the president, not the courts. It is a lie that if anything happen the courts are to blame.1/31 Sean Spicer (and later Trump) blasts the press for calling the ban against immigrants a ban. So the ban was not a ban, even when Trump had tweeted the day before that “If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into”… I don’t even know how to call this!1/25 He lied about the popular vote results saying that between 3 and 5 million voted illegally, and about the Pew report.The Pew report that he mentioned as showing that millions of illegal votes were casted, doesn’t show that. It says that the system is antiquated and that millions of people are registered to vote in more than one state (for example, his top assessor Steve Banon, his daughter Tiffany, Ivanka’s husband Jared Kushner…). That’s not illegal, as long as you vote more than once. So what does the Pew report says? David Becker, Pew’s director, said that the center’s findings did not suggest any kind of voter fraud or voter suppression from these problems but noted they do “underscore the need for an improved system.”And regarding the “major investigation” that Trump was going to conduct regarding the fraud… anyone know if was even launched?1/22 And then, to defend Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false statement about the inauguration attendance, the US Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway coined the “alternative facts” phrase. In that same interview she also lied saying that the photos during Trump’s inauguration the audience look smaller because of the use of white ground coverings during the inauguration, that were used this year for the first time.  The white ground coverings had been used in 2013 when Obama was sworn in for the second term.1/21 First day as a president and… he lied about the the inauguration crowds. He also personally silenced government agencies that showed facts that may show the truth, and instructed his press secretary to lie.So far, the best estimates to the people attending his inauguration are around 300K and 600K… compared to 800K of Clinton in 1994, or Obama’s 1 million in 2013… or 1.8 million in Obama’s first inauguration (2009). While this numbers are estimates, the differences between his inauguration and Obama’s is so big than just looking at a picture will do… and that’s probably the reason that he personally told the Parks Services to stop posting pictures and delete those that were already posted.",6,60,3,None,57,,2017-02-11 03:12:19,

53,5fszid,[Meta] Is political fact-checking still relevant?,None,"In this last election cycle, we saw quite a lot of ridiculous untruths espoused by those running for office, untruths that were easily debunked, and even untruths that could be debunked by the politician's own comments, still available for perusing on their own social media channels.This doesn't seem to have mattered at all. Voters overwhelmingly seemed to support candidates more on personality and appeal to emotion than policy and fact.What's more, the response to the mention of political fact-checking seems to be to simply dismiss those who are doing the fact-checking as biased.This is clearly an ad hominem attack, and I have tried to dissuade it in posters here, even when the source in question is one generally agreed to be highly disreputable - this is a context that is important to keep in mind when weighing a claim, certainly, and in absence of any supporting evidence this definitely seems like an indicator that the claim is fabricated, but facts are facts regardless of who is saying them, and something true is true even if spoken by a known liar, so simply saying the source of a claim or a fact-check is biased is not in any way a refutation of that claim or fact-check... yet the claims of bias are still widely used to dismiss such claims or fact-checks that people don't agree with, even the political candidates themselves, and even when that source is so vague and far-reaching as ""the media"".On a more personal note, I myself have been accused on separate occasions of being biased in favor of Clinton... and of Sanders... and of Trump. Apparently, you don't even need to have a bias to have a bias anymore, you simply need to state a fact that is more favorable to one candidate or their positions, and that in itself is apparently a bias.So in the wake of all of this... what's the damn point? It seems that America has collectively decided that facts don't matter anymore and that everything is subjective based on your own personal political views.

56,5e7rhk,A campaign to educate against propaganda and fake news.,None,"Political fact-bending, spin, propaganda, and outright lying have been present since humans could learn to communicate. It has always happened and it always will happen. To fight against it in the form of fact checking is noble and necessary, but probably not the best use of time, overall. The best use of time is to educate those who are at risk of being subjected to propaganda and spin and fake news. It is to inoculate a population so that the propaganda can't gain a foothold and can't become self-perpetuating. The goal would be to provide a level of ""herd immunity"" to a population by arming them with the tools, methods, and skepticism needed to individually fight back against the most nefarious forms of misinformation. I've been playing around with the idea of trying to create a campaign to do just this on the most prevalent social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit. I would like to attack this problem just as an organization would attack a disease:Step 1: Determine the most widely used and/or truth-damaging methods (vectors) that misinformation spreads. Step 2: Determine the locations (hosts) on the internet and in the real world where those methods of spreading misinformation is particularly effective. Step 3: Target these locations and the methods with counter measures, hopefully educating enough people that these misinformation ""diseases"" stop taking hold so easily. Here's a hypothetical example - Say that Steps 1 and 2 above reveal that blog posts which routinely link to their own articles as references are not found to be reliable news sources. A campaign to target that could be created to urge people to look for this kind of behavior. Similarly with known red flags like Click Bait titles, particularly inflammatory language, ominous background music, etc. I believe we can educate people against the influence of misinformation and fake news in the same way a population can gain herd immunity against a disease via immunizations. I wanted to run this idea by some like-minded people to see what they think and to see if there was any interest in this.

79,4vthdo,Post Claims Trumps Tax Plan will net him $1.9mil at $75300 gross income,None,"[Facebook Post](http://imgur.com/a/tFnei)This post has gone viral on Facebook and I'd like to take a moment to point out how littered with errors and bad assumptions it is:1. He sets this all up in the context of retiring. Most people have access to a pretax retirement: 401k, simple IRA, Traditional IRA. If he wanted this as retirement savings, he doesn't even have to pay the trump tax.2. ~~Presidents only control Federal tax rates not state. He assumes that he is ONLY taxed by the Federal Government. In Florida, he'd pay another 6% on top of that.~~ ^1 This 6% is a sales tax, I live in Nebraska, which has a fair amount of Income tax. I believe there is still social security and medicare withholdings amounting to 7.65% (please correct me if I'm wrong, I neglected this the first time around).3. He has no understanding of how marginal tax rates work. He assumes he'll pay $18825.00 (25% of $75,300) per year in federal taxes Under Hillary. His effective Federal tax rate would be approximately 13.7% under Hillary and 3.3% under Trump.4. ~~With information from 2 and 3, his estimate of per paycheck differential goes from $434 per paycheck to $300 per paycheck.~~ ^1 Per change in 2, swapping state tax with Social Security and Medicare withholdings, his estimate of $434 per paycheck changes to $253.66 per paycheckThe above are objectively wrong. I understand that his point was to maximize the difference between the two but here are some subjective, reality based errors:1. Realistically, one doesn't put 100% of a raise into investments. For example I invest ~28% of my net income and would probably continue at around that rate with a raise. 2. In my opinion, the 10% is very high. Current long-term expectations peg the S&P 500 around 4-7% (Source: I have a relative who's a VP of an Investment management firm.). 4-7% would put his earnings, assuming 30% of net income invested for 30 years, between ~~$126,000~~ ^1 $106,530.86 and ~~$220,000~~ ^1 $184,599.83.3. He assumes equal markets while using a measure (the tax rate) that will directly affect the market. Moody's Analytics is an unbiased research center which has pegged annual growth rates under each candidate taken at face value: [Annual 5.7% over 10 years for Hillary](http://imgur.com/a/P1SzN), [Annual 4% over 10 years for Trump](http://imgur.com/a/8LNdU). Using these differences, I extrapolated my current investment rate through Trump and Hillary's tax plans, holding those annual rates constant throughout (essentially what he did with the 10% rate), over the course of 40 years. These investments would be worth $1.77mil under Hillary's Economy and $1.34mil under Trumps Economy. The interest alone, under Hillary's 5.7% annual growth rate, would be $1.30mil, almost equal to Trumps Principal plus interest accrued (This shows the power of compound interest.). The inflection point of when I would come out ahead in Hillary's Economy, with these assumptions, is at 15 years of investing. Before then, admittedly, the Trump Economy would benefit me.Edit 1: Attempted to make changes per first paragraph by /u/toasters_are_great . Swapped State Taxes with Social Security and Medicare withholdings. Did not take into account tax deductible state taxes, ""shapes"" of the S&P 500 curve that may be advantages for investors front end loading Trump, or inflation due to limited time at work.

91,4o1r19,This email circulating about Obama's pro-Islam record,None,"ALL Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed! Before Obama there was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America. • All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools. • All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses. • All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons. • All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture. • All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them. • All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia  Law. • All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in ""anti-Muslim speech"". • All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."" • All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. • All of a sudden, our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS. • All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted. • All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs. • All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers. • All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter.  A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress. • All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East. • All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states.  He demands to close the facility. • All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer. • All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's ""Syrian refugee"" resettlement programs. • All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the  USA. • All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American  Citizens.  • All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian Funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant)  commitments.  All of a sudden, I’m sick to my stomach.  I’m not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much “progress” has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime!",27,24,8,None,16,,2016-06-14 17:51:24,
92,4nt6iw,"Donald Trump: ""Republicans are Dumb"", why did this video disappear off the internet?",None,"I have no dog in the political race, but 4 months ago saw a video on Facebook where Donald Trump said the following:>“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.”Going on YouTube to find the video now returns zero results. Searching Facebook where it was initially shared returns the same thing. Yet these searches harbor hundreds of comments from other people stating that they too have seen the video which has seemingly gone missing, as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZtfSIgsH1o, and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtE8GISBhM , etc. Which raises the following questions:- Why aren't all of Trumps ***full*** interviews available anywhere? 3 minute clips of Oprah are cute, but not full factual interviews. *(copyright arguments would be waived as the information now falls under fair use: http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/, however YouTube takes things down at* **anyones** *request as their system is so broken it spawned numerous protests that even got the CEOs attention (#WTFU, #MakeYouTubeGreatAgain, etc.))*- If YouTube's claim system is this easily exploitable and copyright was stopping Oprah, Howard Stern and the like from being uploaded, why are selective parts from those interviews that paint Trump in a positive light the only ones allowed to stay? Last time I checked, Fair Use for things like educational purposes didn't just cover the parts of them that make someone look good (see: Coke/Pepsi branding laws in movies.)- Why is the quote in question suddenly being attributed to People Magazine when the words were spoken on video?- Why, if the video does hopefully turn up, were Google's search results hiding everything as far back as 1993?- Why again, if the quote supposedly came from People *Magazine*, is - *""Trump republicans  ...'are stupid'""* - the number one most-searched autocomplete result on **YouTube**, the place people go to find ***videos***?It brings up another set of interesting points:- The idea that a video is being copyright flagged on both YouTube and Facebook the instant it's uploaded is not out of the realm of possibility. There's a reason finding SNL clips is so hard.- The misattribution of the quote (to People Magazine, instead of the original videos source) is a tactic that has been around for decades used to fool people into thinking something didn't happen/wasn't true and - it's more important purpose - to stop people who actually do their research from researching the given subject *further* and deter them from finding out what truly happened.- The obvious argument that Trump calling people names is virtually his campaign slogan at this point so the idea of him saying something that harsh/that way is absolutely within said realm of possibility.- The peculiar fact that it appears as if no one has even raised the question of whether or not the quote was true on Reddit.- And arguably the biggest issue, of whether or not the ecosystems involved (YouTube, Google, Facebook...) have become closed enough - *and the public has become comfortable enough* - to truly let something ""disappear"" in 2016. (Shoutouts to /r/news.)I'm a psychoanalyst and the exact quote in question is remarkably in line with the behavioral patterns and traits he typically displays. The idea that people would flock to video sharing websites to find a *text quote* is also remarkably strange. Trump himself, is the same man who was caught *being his own fake publicist*, tasked with the sole purpose of praising himself which he then lied about on camera multiple times and simultaneously slipping up (from a psychology perspective) by showing tells in the same sentence that he was aware of what he did while saying he wasn't... the list goes on.As said psychoanalyst it's typical not to rule out the possibility of someone merely ""mis-remembering"" things. But for a metric shit-ton of people to mis-remember the same thing, the *exact same way*, and look for it in the ***exact same places*** all via the privacy of their own homes? Having seen the video, having noticed the selectively chosen parts of copyrighted work that *are allowed* to be displayed in public while the rest stays forever missing, the timestamps of Google's search results for the quote in question not adding up I mean...  how many coincidences am I allowed to list here before I break the Reddit EULA?But in the end, it merely begs the question. Has anyone else *here* seen this video?

105,4ab0d9,This Facebook post seems to claim that almost everything bad in the Clinton administration was due to decisions by Hillary. Did she actually have this much power?,None,">If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!>When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.>Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.>Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.>Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.>Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.>Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. >Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.>Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the #$%$ eruption” and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:>She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.>She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. >After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.>Hillary’s devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.>Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.>After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.>hat a swell party – ready for another four or eight year of this type of low-life mess?>Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next.

110,43ymq1,Scoring politicians' truthfulness by rolling up PolitiFact metrics,None,"While visiting [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/) this evening, I noticed that while the service provides a histogram of the outcomes of its research about specific statements ([here's Obama's record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/)), it doesn't actually provide a single metric of the individual's overall propensity for truthfulness.There may be good reasons for that - PolitiFact is far from a reference-quality data source. Let's acknowledge some limitations:* PolitiFact does not evaluate a truly random sample of each candidate's statements; it picks and chooses, based partly on the statements that are most provocative (like [Sarah Palin's ""death panels"" comment](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/10/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-barack-obama-death-panel/), which PolitiFact aptly summarizes as ""Sci-fi scenario not based in reality""). (PolitiFact is also vulnerable to the [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Gish), where a speaker issues such a high volume of bad statements that the fact-checkers can't even keep up!)* PolitiFact's methods certainly aren't rigorous; delinations such as ""mostly true,"" ""half true,"" and ""mostly false"" are qualitative and subjective.* Sample sizes vary: PolitiFact has evaluated [86 of Donald Trump's statements](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) but only [18 by Martin O'Malley](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/martin-omalley/).Nevertheless, PolitiFact *seems* more or less disinterested, as in not driven by any obvious political agenda, and their ratings don't *seem* overly skewed or dubious. So despite the squishiness of the data, I thought it would be interesting to generate a composite metric for various candidates based on their scores.My methodology is easy. PolitiFact rates statements in five categories: True, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, and False / Pants On Fire! (which differ not by degree of falseness, but by the outrageousness of the statement). Let's interpret those ratings as their percentage of truth - 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% - and roll them up into an average truth content of each candidate's statements.For Barack Obama:Rating|Percent of Statements|Weighted Percentage (i.e., Truthfulness):--|:--|:--True (100%)|21%|21%Mostly True (75%)|27%|20.25%Half True (50%)|27%|13.5%Mostly False (25%)|12%|3%False or Pants On Fire (0%)|14%|0%**Average**| |57.75%Let's score the other candidates (and some relevant non-candidates) the same way - ordered by truthfulness. (*Yes, I know this is not scientific or rigorous. See the acknowledgments above. It's just interesting.*)Candidate|Truthfulness|:--|:--John Kasich|58.25%Hillary Clinton|57.5%Bernie Sanders|56%Jeb Bush|55.5%Rand Paul|53.5%Chris Christie|49.75%Martin O'Malley|48.75%Marco Rubio|47%Carly Fiorina|36%Rick Santorum|35%Ted Cruz|29.5%Donald Trump|17.5%Ben Carson|15.75%And here are the scores for some other notable personalities:Personality|Truthfulness|:--|:--Barack Obama|57.75%Joe Biden|52%Debbie Wasserman Schultz|47.5%Mitch McConnell|46.5%Mike Huckabee|43.5%Scott Walker|42.75%Rick Perry|42.5%John Boehner|42.25%Sarah Palin|40.75%Nancy Pelosi|36.75%Michele Bachmann|21.5%(Several notable politicians just had too few scores to make a good estimate, even under these relaxed conditions - e.g., George W.

The video in question is being used as a tool to discredit the needs of refugees and claim that letting refugees into the US will be incredibly harmful. If this still does not fall appropriately into the Guidelines for US politics only, let me know, but I dearly hope this receives the attention I feel it deserves and the cooperative efforts of the community to fact check the claims and sources being used here to deny entry to refugees.)Hey, First time poster here. So recently on social media, the following video report on muslim refugees has been floating around.http://buzzpo.com/this-is-the-most-disturbing-muslim-refugee-video-you-will-ever-see/Sensationalist xenophobia makes me want to vomit and the video appears to be just that.After watching the video, I decided I wanted to pull it apart in three pieces and either confirm the real issues presented here, or utterly discredit them. The video is 20 minutes long and this undertaking is way bigger than one guy can reasonably do. So I thought to myself, ""There must be a Reddit for this kind of thing."" Imagine my relief when ""fact check reddit"" returned this. :)So here's the plan. The extent of fact-checking and source identification here is huge, but I'm concerned that a lot, if not the majority of the video has no direct correlation with the refugee crisis. So in an attempt to analyze the video's claims and audio/visual sources, we'd break it down as follows:**Claims****Audio Source Credibility****Visual Source Credibility**By providing a time-stamp for each section of video, we should be able to track the visual and audio sources and determine if they do in fact pertain to the refugee situation or if they were pulled from alternate sources with no connection.Additionally, there are many claims made that I'd like to analyze for verification.**NOTE** As sources are found, the OP will be updated to reflect findings, confirmations, or counterindications for each portion of the video.Thoughts?

162,2m76ci,Is it really that much more expensive to execute death row inmates?,None,"There's a common political fact thrown around when discussing capital punishment, that it costs significantly more to execute a prisoner on death row, than keeping them in jail for the rest of their lives. It's often stated very matter-of-factly, as if it's self-evident, and never explained.Rather than try to find all the various places where I've seen this repeated, let's just focus our attention on [this article](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29552692/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/execute-or-not-question-cost/#.VGTeJLfF9De) from the Associated Press, which states: > Turns out, it is cheaper to imprison killers for life than to execute them, according to a series of recent surveys. Tens of millions of dollars cheaper, politicians are learning, during a tumbling recession when nearly every state faces job cuts and massive deficits.> So an increasing number of them are considering abolishing capital punishment in favor of life imprisonment, not on principle but out of financial necessity.The author continues as if some unextraordinary fact has been established, and never revisits it, even though it serves as the premise of the whole article.This seems absurd to me. It's not just cheaper, it's ***""tens of millions of dollars""*** cheaper. Let's assume housing an inmate for their entire natural life (say, 30 more years) costs $0 (which it obviously doesn't), that means that executing someone who has already been sentenced, and is already in custody, costs at a minimum $20,000,000. I can't fathom what would account for even 1% of that cost. So I turn to you guys for an explanation of why executing a single prisoner humanely costs the full-time annual salary of 200 well-paid people.Of course, not trying to start anything political about the death penalty itself.

Presumably, in attempt to make it look like gun-related murders declined after Florida passed the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, when the really increased.The thing is the graph is so ridiculously bad, I was shocked Reuters would actually publish it, so I did some digging in an attempt to verify the information.Here's where I am:1) Despite a lot of Googling & digging on reuters.com, I can't find the actual Reuters article.  If it's just because I suck & someone could link to it, that answers all my questions:  They did publish it & I just suck at searching.2) I can't find a ""C. Chan"" on staff at Reuters.  I found an ""[Eddie Chan](http://blogs.reuters.com/eddie-chan/page/2/)"", but he seems to only cover technology.  The graph on the BI page states the date is 2/16, but there's nothing from him published on gun deaths around that time.

Searching on twitter, I *think* I found what is the original tweet:https://twitter.com/hrtbps/status/455966095384793088/photo/1I asked @hrtbps for the source, but haven't heard back yet.

According to FDLE there were 1387.- There is no year that had 873 deaths.- The graph indicates there were 721 deaths in 2012.  According to the FDLE there were 1,009.- There is no year that had 721 deaths.This is what a graph of the full FDLE actually looks like:http://i.imgur.com/u2TE8aW.png* For some reason the FDLE data is missing for 1968, hence the gap.Here's what a graph of the 1990-present looks like:http://i.imgur.com/Y3SPzPr.png**Note:** At this point, I'm less interested in what conclusion to draw from the graph, as opposed to what the hell actually happened here?!

184,235f69,ACA attack from Sen David Vitter,None,"I received an email from U.S. Senator David Vitter.  I pasted the core message below.  Most of it seems at least misleading but some looks like flat out lies."" Literally, there are 20 new taxes from Obamacare. That's outrageous and exactly the reason we need to repeal it. But let me highlight a few of the more egregious taxes from Obamacare for you.    The Medicine Cabinet Tax: Because of Obamacare, you are longer able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement account (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (thankfully insulin is exempted).    The ""Special Needs Kids Tax"": Parents of special needs children often rely on flexible spending accounts (FSA) to pay for special needs education. Obamacare significantly cuts the amount a family can use, resulting in a major tax on those and other families who use FSAs.    The Employer Mandate Tax: If an employer does not offer health coverage, they're forced to pay an additional non-deductible tax of $2000 or more for each full-time employee. Our economy is not exactly strong enough for employers to take on that hefty expense. And of course, the granddaddy of them all...    The Individual Mandate Tax: Simply a tax on you if you don't have insurance and you don't buy the unwanted Obamacare.Congress recently pulled a fast one and exempted themselves and staff from Obamacare. I'm fighting to have Congress live under the same Obamacare rules as everyone else, and I've refused the lucrative health care subsidy members of Congress currently receive. If you can't get exempted from Obamacare, Congress absolutely shouldn't either. ""I know the Employer mandate only applies to employers with 50 employees so that part's deceptive.  Is any more of this a bald faced lie?  Thanks.",6,26,14,Please Verify,12,,2014-04-16 05:39:33,2014-04-16 20:53:46

Mike Quigley:The bill, H.R. 992 or the “Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act,” would severely limit the reach of Sec. 716 in Dodd-Frank, which requires banks that are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Federal Reserve lending discounts to spin off their derivatives activities into separate corporate entities that would not be eligible for federal assistance.According to the New York Times, lobbyists from Citigroup played a major role in the bill’s creation: “Citigroup’s recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House committee’s 85-line bill,” Eric Lipton and Ben Protess write. “Two crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.

Many regulators and economists agree Section 716 is problematic because in its current form, it would actually create a MORE dangerous environment in which swaps would trade because they would be removed from the heavily-regulated bank holding companies and put into less-regulated environments. Further, HR 992 does not allow depository institutions to deal in the type of structured asset-backed swaps that contributed significantly to the economic collapse of 2008. As Barney Frank himself said, it “addresses the valid criticisms of Section 716 without weakening the financial reform law’s important derivative safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary trading.”I would love some additional insight from you guys.

Subsequently, they will be able to conduct forced home visits without a warrant. Things such as a (yet undefined) bad grade, missing more than 5 days in school in any one month, can get a parent to be declared guilty of educational neglect. Having a gun or beer in your house can get your children removed from your custody. Even the traditional act of grounding your child for misbehavior will get you declared to be guilty of “isolation neglect” and subject your child for removal from your authority and your home. If you are a parent and you have not heard of this provision of Obamacare, I would suggest you read the 110 page manual that was created by the United Nations.

275,13b1z0,Does Obama care require businesses of 50+ employees to pay healthcare for any employee working 30+ hours?,None,"This has been popping up in my news feed a lot.  Is it true? ""...two policies that bear primary blame (for the downturn in th economy that is about to occur) are ObamaCare and the fiscal cliff. Markets and business owners are struggling to prepare for these two gut punches. With the fiscal cliff, of course, higher taxes could have a crippling effect, particularly small businesses' ability to hire or expand. But ObamaCare is doing much the same thing in a way that will only worsen as tentacles of regulation extend ever further.There are many more MANDATES in the law besides the infamous individual mandate to buy health insurance. For example, businesses of 50 or more employees face the crushing burden of providing full, (approved) benefits to employees that work more than 30 hours -- considered ""full-time"" employees per the decree of the new law -- or fines of $2,000 per employee if they don't comply. The response is entirely predictable: Businesses avoid hiring that 50th employee and reduce hours for their current employees or pay the penalty, which is often cheaper than insurance, leaving employees on government exchanges.Darden Restaurants, the chain that owns Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Longhorn Steakhouse and others, falls into the latter category. The chain announced in October that it would begin limiting employee hours. McDonald's, White Castle and Denny's, among others, are expected to do likewise... John Schnatter, CEO of Papa John's, estimates that ObamaCare will cost the company between $5 million to $8 million annually, translating to reduced employee hours and of course higher prices.all growth oriented businesses are between the proverbial rock and a hard place. ObamaCare will cost them a fortune, but cutting employee hours and benefits and raising prices to account for it leaves them serving as the lightning rod -- by design. Businesses skirting the law by restructuring their workforce will face retribution from the White House. Washington DC, employment law attorney Robert B. Fitzpatrick said as much when he noted that if businesses are ""just playing with the numbers to avoid compliance... there are going to be consequences.""",71,56,9,Mostly True,47,,2012-11-16 19:22:07,2012-11-17 08:14:53

347,11e5rh,Washington Post claims Heritage study on Romney tax plan incorrectly estimates savings from estate tax change. Is this criticism accurate?,None,"As I'm sure you're all aware, the Tax Policy Center published a study claiming Romney's tax plan is impossible. Heritage published [a study](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/tax-policy-centers-skewed-analysis-of-governor-romneys-tax-plan#_ftn9) soon thereafter, written by Curtis Dubay, claiming that the TPC was wrong. Among other things, Dubay cited the elimination of [stepped-up basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped-up_basis) as a source of possible savings. Dubay referenced [this CBO study](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/spec.pdf) (large PDF, pages 261, 272) for his cost savings estimates.The Washington Post published [a critique of the Heritage study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/26/how-to-make-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-add-up-sort-of/) claiming that the stepped-up basis estimate was incorrect.>The $19 billion figure is how less the current system takes in than if all assets were taxed at capital gains rates at death. That’s a much more dramatic change than the one Dubay is proposing, so Dubay’s change will likely bring in “much less revenue than implied by the tax expenditure estimate,” Looney says.I think this criticism is incorrect and would like to know what others think. Here's what Dubay's study says about eliminating the stepped-up basis rule:>Plans that properly repeal the death tax typically employ a system, after repeal, whereby heirs pay capital gains tax when they sell inherited assets using as the basis the price paid by the person from whom they inherited the asset. This is called “carry-over” basis.The CBO figure he cites is comparing the current stepped-up basis system to the following:>Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed when assets are transferred at death or by gift.The only difference I can see between Dubay's proposal and the CBO analysis is that appreciation on property passed at death would not be taxed until the heir sells the property. Imagine I buy property for $10, its worth $20 at my death, and my heir sells it for $30 ten years after my death. Under Dubay's proposal, my heir pays capital gains tax on $20 ten years after my death. Under the CBO analysis, my estate pays capital gains tax on $10 at my death and my heir pays $10 in capital gains when he sells. This would mean slightly less revenue because of time value of money considerations, but I don't think it would be ""much less"" and I don't think these two scenarios are ""dramatically different.""Are there other factors that I'm missing? Do you think the CBO baseline and the carry-over basis Dubay proposes are substantially different such that using the CBO figures makes Dubay's study wrong?",3,13,2,Please Verify,11,"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/tax-policy-centers-skewed-analysis-of-governor-romneys-tax-plan#_ftn9),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped-up_basis),http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/spec.pdf),http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/26/how-to-make-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-add-up-sort-of/)",2012-10-13 03:19:05,

One source often cited is the Laffer Curve:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curveObviously this calls into question the current US income rates above $35k in the US, although arguably if you also consider Payroll taxes, any American making over $8700/yr is paying a combined income tax of at least ~25%. It appears there should be ample proof that this magic 20% number is simply untrue. But - is it?Since tax percentages can be complicated, let's define the rate in question as the Effective Income Tax Rate - what each individual pays in total to the government, over their income, annually.For fun, here's a link to a Daily Show interview with Rand Paul where he cites this oft-cited fact, that may or may not be a fact:http://www.thedailyshow.com/extended-interviews/376788/playlist_tds_extended_rand_paul/376554",25,20,8,Please Verify,12,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curveObviously,http://www.thedailyshow.com/extended-interviews/376788/playlist_tds_extended_rand_paul/376554",2012-10-04 21:21:58,2012-10-11 07:31:52

The close we get to debates / elections the harder it will be to actually fact check all of the questions coming in. There is no point fact checking something that while they may have a good question, the way they worded it makes it unverifiable.Mods, sorry if I am stepping on toes or asked the meta question in the wrong way :) If I did just let me know.Section: What is verifiableNot every question can be verified for a number of reason. Please form all questions in a way that can be answered by a Yes/No answer. For example:Good Questions: * Person X said that he created 5,000 jobs in the US during 2010, is this true?* Company Y said ""Person X has increased the spending of the government by $5,000 per person living in the US since 2008"", is this true?Bad Questions:* Person X said that he created jobs, how many did he create?* Company Y said ""Person X spends more than anyone else in history"" Thoughts?* Is it possible that person X spent more than 5 million on funding?When posting a question try and keep it so that there is only a single fact to be checked. Asking for an ad to be checked that has 10 questions means that it cannot be answered Yes/No, you have to check 10 different questions and 5 may be true and 5 may be false. A better way to do this is to submit 10 different posts, 1 for each fact.The state of mind for a person or a company cannot be checked. There is no way for us to know if Company X intentionally misreported something. However we can check if they did misreport something. For example:Good Question: News station X stated that Person Y created 5million jobs over the 2009 and 2010 calendar years, is this true?Bad Question: Did News station X purposefully state that Person Y created 5million jobs in 2009/2010 when he actually created 10million jobs?The question you ask should make sure to include enough details that you are not misquoting an article. If the question is really long due to a very specific figure being quoted, put the subject in the title such as ""Does statue X do Y [Details Inside]"". Then you can place the full question in the text part of the post. The reason is that a lot of times a headline is a few words to grab attention. If you read the article the real question may be ""Does statue X do Y when you live in state Z and are under the age of 18 and are not emancipated."" Where this is very brief, the question may really take up 4 or 5 sentences.When asking a question please give a source (or many if you have them) regarding the question.

Because they are poor, any additional money they get is money they will likely *need* to spend on goods and services. On the other hand, someone who is rich is more likely to let any tax cut sit in a bank account somewhere, or some hedge fund, where its benefit to the economy is minimal by comparison. Additionally, if a rich person *does* spend that money, they are more likely to spend it overseas, where it isn't going to do the American economy much good.To me, this seems self-evident, but I have never really had factual data to back it up, and I know that there are many who believe otherwise.

Is there any good way that we can all agree on to determine that a source *isn't* guilty of bias or false equivalency? Likewise, is there any good way to determine that a source unquestionably *is*, and on a regular enough basis that that source can be deemed untrustworthy?Clearly, some sources are beyond reproach - the content of a bill can be confirmed or denied by simply looking at the bill itself, and whether someone said something can often be made undeniably clear by video footage of them saying it.

The assumption is that the number of cloture motions proves the use of the filibuster, but there's reason to believe otherwise.http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304707604577424491399594250.html> So Republicans are to blame for all those cloture petitions to end filibusters, right? Wrong. The fact that the majority has filed so many cloture petitions is as much a symptom of its own efforts to block the Senate from working its will as anything the minority has done. Consider this example.> On March 19, Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) introduced legislation (S. 2204) to promote renewable energy with the cost offset by a tax hike on large oil producers. The normal process would have been for this legislation to be referred to committee for action.> Majority Leader Harry Reid bypassed the committee process, however, and using something called Rule 14 had the bill placed directly on the Senate calendar. Two days later, he started the process to call up the bill by moving to ""proceed to it"" and immediately filed a cloture petition to end debate on that motion.> The following Monday, the Senate then voted 92-4 to curtail debate on the motion to proceed to the bill. The next day, as soon as the bill was before the Senate, Mr. Reid offered five consecutive amendments and one motion in order to effectively block the consideration of any competing amendments or motions.> He then filed a cloture motion to close out debate on the bill. Two days later, the Senate rejected cloture on a party-line vote and moved on to other business, leaving the Menendez bill adrift.> Now go back to the Politico story and ask yourself how exactly Republicans filibustered this bill? They didn't have time to filibuster anything, it was over so quickly. Moreover, their ability to take meaningful action was effectively nullified by four specific parliamentary maneuvers taken by Mr. Reid.This photo is often used to claim that the filibuster is being used often:http://www.balloon-juice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cloture.jpgIf the Senate leadership is filing for cloture immediately upon the introduction of a bill, is it really a filibuster?",37,36,8,Unverifiable,28,"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304707604577424491399594250.html>,http://www.balloon-juice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cloture.jpgIf",2012-09-21 18:37:49,2012-09-23 07:23:21

My *opinion* on this is that the piss poor job the banks did handing out loans and fleecing the public contributed to this.  I could be totally wrong about this.  * I have not done the maths yet, but here is the [US Gov unemployment chart](http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet) .  You will have to manually change the year range, but you can see that unemployment rate skyrocketed right after the recession took a dive.  [This image may work...](http://data.bls.gov/generated_files/graphics/latest_numbers_LNS14000000_2000_2012_all_period_M08_data.gif)Again, to think that the day Obama stepped into the White House as President this all happened HAS to be because of external forces not directly related to him taking office.  Looking at the recovery period starting at the end of 2009 (almost 2 years of unemployment rate going up), there as been a steady decline, which is good, but not great.*  I really don't remember gas being that cheap in a while, but a [quick search does reveal](http://www.GasBuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx?city1=USA Average&city2=&city3=&crude=n&tme=96&units=us) that in fact it was that low.  I do not really see the correlation between who was President and gas prices.  I thought gas prices were determined by oil speculators that ""guess"" how much a barrel of oil should cost and [basic supply and demand](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/gas-prices.asp#axzz26mCUWzVP) metrics.  I also think that the BP oil spill has something to do with rising gas prices during and after the disaster - supply low + demand high = higher gas prices?* ""National Debt"" is a broad term to me.  There are my types of government debt and metrics that go with it.  IIRC, under Clinton, we had a surplus and under GW Bush, that got turned around into a debt.  [This chart](http://www.usfederalbudget.us/spending_chart_1996_2012USr_13s1li111lcn_G0f) illustrates the *Federal Deficit*, which I think is a more accurate metric.  I don't think *public debt* which I think the FB image depicts is an accurate representation of ""debt"" illustrated [here](http://www.usfederalbudget.us/spending_chart_1996_2012USr_13s1li111lcn_H0f).*  I do not have any real knowledge on the National budget and cannot really comment on this.  I do know that there was a 1000+ day period where NO budget was passed.  The proposal from Obama was downvoted 97-0, meaning that NO ONE approved it.  Republican Paul Ryan, his bill was also voted against and lost.  I do understand that pushing a budgt through is the same as planning spending money at home whether to buy groceries or a car.  That's like me handing my wife a budget for the month that allows me to buy 5 TV's, but no groceries... I'll be getting my nuts kicked in.  Either way, whether this is Obama's fault or the Senates fault (I find both equally as guilty), no one there seems to be able to get their heads out of their asses to make a non-partisan agreement to make a budget.  *  This is just a blatant lie all around...

Like most of the RNC/DNC speeches, it was mostly encouragement and appealed to the emotions; it didn't contain many factual claims or figures that can be verified or disproven. I will say that I believe he killed it, he's always been quite a fantastic speaker in my opinion. So far I've collected these (more to come):*from [ABC's transcript](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/transcript-president-obamas-democratic-convention-speech/story?id=17175575#.UEl3O41lTYg), which contains a few minor errors (e.g. it says ""the next founder of Google"" instead of ""the next Steve Jobs"", I thought this was quite humorous)*>I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they'd never build another American car. Today, they can't build them fast enough, because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world.---->I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers – goods that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America.---->After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years. And now you have a choice: we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here, in the United States of America. We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years---->After thirty years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We've doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day – more than any administration in recent history. And today, the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades.---->But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan, or endanger our coastlines, or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers.---->If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone.---->For the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders.---->Around the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.

476,zgq76,A few reminders to our new community,None,"Hello everyone! To start with, I'd like to thank the new community that has been built here. We're seeing some amazing questions, excellent discussion, and downright civil interactions I wasn't sure could exist in a political subreddit.That said, a few housekeeping items to remind everyone about.**This subreddit is organic and new.** There may be methods or policies you aren't a fan of or that don't quite work yet. If there's something you'd like to see improved or changed, please don't hesitate to ask. Myself and the other mods want the integrity of this subreddit to be above everything else.**Second**, when it comes to assigning a final rating to a post, I want to remind you all that the rating is reflective of that mod's best ability to be objective. It is not a set-in-stone rating that trumps discussion. If you disagree with a rating, remember that ratings should not be used as evidence in a political discussion. The real value of these posts is the evidence presented by the community in the threads falling under the initial post. **The final rating only acts as a guide**, but it is you, the reader, who should take the evidence and make a decision based on your own logic and reasoning. We as moderators will attempt to simply justify our rating selection, but please don't turn it into an argument. The rubric we use is in the sidebar for reference. --->**Third**, please remember this is not /r/politics. This is a fact-finding subreddit. We are not here to debate policies or beliefs, but to discuss the immediate validity of a posted statement. Pretty much every post in a discussion should be a fact-based reference complete with citations or explanation of data. **We will not tolerate opinion debates** and they will be deleted accordingly. If they continue, warnings will be issued and if those are ignored, bans given. For this subreddit to function, we need to leave our feelings at the door and look at solid sources.Thank you again to all of you. from what I'm seeing this is going to be a useful source for culling factual information together. Based on these posts, people will be able to make better-informed decisions and to share it with others.*Lux et Veritas*",25,30,3,Mod Post/Meta,27,,2012-09-06 22:31:20,2012-09-07 20:06:02

Current thinking is that once the community appears to have reached critical mass in it's research, one of the mods would announce to the group that we will change the ""Flair"" of the post from ""Please Verify"" to the Verdict of the group research at that time. Then we would give the community some time to voice it's opinion, or find other new data, and then if nothing new comes to light we'd update the post's Flair. Open question: How much time from the initial mod posting that we are about to change the ""Fact-Flair"" until we do? A few hours?

I don’t know…A lot of people just want to tell themselves they are making things better by doing something. Whether it actually helps doesn't matter because they just want to make themselves feel all warm and fuzzy with a false sense of security and self-righteousness for helping others. And it's not the thought that counts because they are actually lowering everyone's safety by masking the real problem allowing it to get worse while making people more vulnerable because of their ignorance and false sense of safety. Politicians are great at making bubbles via social engineering and this is no different. You can live in your little dream world and pretend that banning guns is going to make you and the world safer, and it might stop a few accidents and a few suburbia-on-suburbia shootings, but not dealing with the problem of mental health and closely tied poverty will only make the issue of violence worse. Desperate people resort to desperate measures. I think a lot of the people who are against radical gun control have some real justification, not because they think that the loss of even one individual isn't important but that if we are not careful we will end up with a ""war on guns"" much like the ""war on drugs."" And if you don't know anything about drugs or wars the attempt to combine them has been a disaster and in the long run only increased the demand for drugs. It has turned mom and pop meth trailers into high volume meth industries south of the border and ruined the potential of countless people for smoking weed.

How many people does that make a hypocrite. The only superficial statistic you can use to justify harsh penalties for marijuana use is that it is a gateway drug and you have to stop the heavy drug users before they start. Well that is another example of self-righteous warm fuzziness, probably by people that drink regularly. If you had to go to the same circle of people to get your glass of wine as you do to get an 8ball it would not be hard to link wine as a gateway to cocaine. People need to start dealing with their/our problems instead of deferring the accountability to the state or to a god. And I use “their/our” in a completely individualistic and selfish context.

536,1ijb74,10 THINGS THE MEDIA AREN'T TELLING YOU ABOUT THE ZIMMERMAN CASE,None,"Any of these hold any weight. I'm honestly curiousLink: http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/17/10-Facts-the-media-Arent-telling-you-about-the-zimmerman-caseText: 1. There is Zero Evidence Race was Involved In the ShootingEarly last year, as the tragic and fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin was just starting to bubble up, the media falsely described George Zimmerman as ""white."" The name Zimmerman apparently fooled the media into believing they had a white versus black narrative on their hands. Once they learned Zimmerman was Hispanic, rather than change course, in order to cover up their mistake, the media put the pedal to the metal in pushing a racial angle.This crusade, however, is anti-science. A thorough federal investigation into Zimmerman found absolutely no evidence that there was any racism in his past or in his motivations the night of the shooting.During the trial, the prosecution did not accuse Zimmerman of having any kind of racial motive.The one juror who has spoken out said the jury saw no evidence of a racial motivation.The media's racial narrative is based on nothing more than partisan lies, speculation, innuendo, and a cynical alchemy conjured from nothing to enflame division and hate.Moreover, it is reasonable to assume the media have been swarming Zimmerman's life looking for anything that might point to racism. But as of yet there have been no media reports (that weren't later debunked and retracted) reporting Zimmerman has been found to be a closet racist.On the contrary… 2. Zimmerman's Admirable History of Being Colorblind Toward BlacksZimmerman's past indicates he is color blind. He has dated black women, tutored black children, once stood up for a black homeless man against the police (we're told he so desperately wants to impress), has black relatives, and voted for the first black president. 3. Zimmerman is Hispanic, Not WhiteLike President Obama, Zimmerman has one white parent. Quite properly, the media have never referred to Obama as ""half-black,"" a ""self-described black,"" or a ""white black."" Obama is black. Period.Zimmerman, however, has been stripped of his Hispanic racial identity across almost every media outlet in America. Though he is as Hispanic as Obama is black, because it is inconvenient to the white versus black racial narrative the media are hyping, the media refuse to identify Zimmerman as a Hispanic.A full fifteen months after the media learned they had made a mistake and that their prey was Hispanic, some in media are still referring to Zimmerman as ""white.""Those not referring to him as white are either ignoring his racial heritage altogether, or describing him as a ""white Hispanic"" or some variation of a ""self-described Hispanic.""As far as I know, this is an unprecedented editorial decision.Speaking of unprecedented… 4. Obama's Justice Department Has Launched a National Fishing Expedition Against ZimmermanProbably because the reporting of such a frightening and Orwellian act of federal overreach might make look Zimmerman look sympathetic and hurt Obama, the media have apparently decided to ignore Attorney General Eric Holder's public witch hunt. The Justice Department is setting up a public tip line for Americans to ""help build a case against Zimmerman.""In order to build a civil rights case, the government needs evidence of racism.The federal government crowd-sourcing for evidence against a single American is both chilling and something heretofore unheard of.   5. Like Some Conservatives, President Obama Feared Violence After the VerdictOne of the false racially-charged talking points some in media are using against conservatives is that we are racist for fearing there might be violence in the wake of the verdict.Something inconvenient to that narrative is the fact that a black, leftist American president beloved by the media also feared there would be violence in the wake of the verdict. After the verdict was announced, the president released a statement that said in part:I know this case has elicited strong passions.  And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.  But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.  I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.Unfortunately for a race-baiting media, this, one of the president's better moments, has to be ignored in order to serve an artificial narrative.Which brings me to number six… 6. There Has Been Widespread Violence After the VerdictThe fear President Obama and those ""racist"" conservatives shared about the possibility of violence in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict has been vindicated.  In just a few days, Breitbart News has documented over two dozen separate acts of violence and lawlessness throughout the country.The media are dutifully covering up this widespread violence. Yes, they report on each separate act, but always with a ""mostly peaceful"" qualifier. The media also refuse to connect the dots and widen their reportorial context to show the entire picture.One aspect of this lawless spree the racially-obsessed media adamantly refuse to report on are the reported ""hate crimes"" being committed by black against whites and Hispanics.Which brings me to… 7. Zimmerman Protesters Commit Numerous Racially-Motivated Assaults:While the irresponsible media is inventing from whole cloth a racial narrative in the Trayvon shooting, at the same time, they are willfully ignoring actual racially-motivated assaults occurring in the wake of the verdict.Thus far, there have been three reported hate crimes -- actual assaults -- committed by Trayvon supporters. But like the awful murders taking hundreds of black lives in Chicago, the media refuse to call national attention to these verdict-inspired hate crimes because there is no political upside in doing so. How can a liberal media call attention to the violence in Chicago when liberals and liberalism are the problem?  The same thinking holds true for these reported assaults by blacks against Hispanics and whites. To focus on reality might undermine the fabricated narrative that an innocent black teenager was stalked and murdered by a racist white man. 8. ""Stand Your Ground"" Has Nothing to do With the Zimmerman CaseOther than ginning up black turnout for Obama's re-election effort in the crucial swing state of Florida and enflaming racial tensions (which solidifies the Democrat base), another partisan goal the media hopes to achieve from the Zimmerman case is to toxify the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws that currently exist in 30 states.But like the fact that Zimmerman is not white and that there is zero evidence showing race was in any way involved in his actions the night of the shooting, the media have also bumped into another inconvenient reality: ""Stand Your Ground"" had nothing to do with Zimmerman's defense or acquittal.The Zimmerman case was a simple case of self-defense:The jury received standard instructions. Zimmerman did not invoke the Stand Your Ground provision. Zimmerman later waived his right to a pretrial immunity hearing under the Stand Your Ground procedures.And as National Review’s Sterling Beard points out, “The only time Stand Your Ground came up during the trial proper was when a prosecution witness stated that he’d taught a class Zimmerman had attended that covered Stand Your Ground.”Even the prosecution rejects the cynical attempt to tie Martin’s death to Stand Your Ground. Prosecutor John Guy couldn’t have made it clearer during the trial: “This case is not about standing your ground.” During their post-trial press conference, as conservative talk show host Victoria Taft first noted, a Miami Herald reporter asked the prosecution team specifically whether Stand Your Ground “affected the facts in this case and whether this case could have been won, perhaps, pre the changes in the law.”Prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda replied: “You know, self-defense has existed for a long time. And we’ve dealt with it in Jackson for a long time.These facts, though, have failed to stop Eric Holder or the media from pretending the complete opposite is true. 9. Rachel Jeantel Might Be Responsible for the Deadly ConfrontationAn unfortunate mix of marijuana, homophobia, and a friend whispering warnings in your ear at night, could go a long towards explaining why a physical altercation occurred:[CNN's PIERS] MORGAN: And he was freaked out by it [Zimmerman following him]?JEANTEL: Yes. Definitely after I say may be a rapist, for every boy, for every man, every -- who's not that kind of way, seeing a grown man following them, would they be creep out?She continued:""And people need to understand, he didn't want that creepy ass cracker going to his father or girlfriend's house to go get -- mind you, his little brother was there. You know -- now, mind you, I told you -- I told Trayvon it might have been a rapist.""Evidence that shows why Trayvon might have been the aggressor, though, is inconvenient to a media desperate to enflame racial tensions. Moreover, bringing the issue of homophobia into the personal narratives of Trayvon and Jeantel just can't be allowed to happen.This bombshell has been swept under the rug just as effectively as the other nine. 10. The Florida Justice System's Leniency Towards Trayvon Led to His DeathIn order to make his crime statistics look good, Police Chief Charles Hurley of the Miami-Dade School Police Department is suspected of juicing the numbers by treating outright crimes as simple disciplinary problems. As Robert Stacy McCain reports in the American Spectator, Trayvon Martin ended up being a victim of this practice.Instead of being arrested and charged after being found with a burglary tool and 13 pieces of jewelry stolen from a house a half-mile from the school, Trayvon was suspended from school. Trayvon was also caught with marijuana:Either of those incidents could have put Trayvon Martin into the custody of the juvenile justice system. However, because of Chief Hurley’s attempt to reduce the school crime statistics — according to sworn testimony, officers were “basically told to lie and falsify” reports — Martin was never arrested. And if he had been arrested, he might never have been in Sanford the night of his fatal encounter with Zimmerman.What we have here is a case of police corruption in which the media have shown no interest, even though you can connect the dots to Trayvon's tragic death.But to report this story would mean upsetting the narrative that Trayvon was an innocent (like many of us at 17, he got in trouble) and that the only cause of his death was a racist white man protected by racist white laws (passed almost unanimously by Republicans and Democrats).--While the simple and noble act of reporting the full truth might help to ease tensions, as racial violence breaks out across the country, the media have shown no remorse for enflaming citizens with falsehoods.Sadly, the media have not even signaled that they might slow down.If anything, the media are just warming up for what they seem to hope will be ""a long, hot weekend.""",26,0.0,0.0,Please Verify,0,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/17/10-Facts-the-media-Arent-telling-you-about-the-zimmerman-caseText:,2013-07-18 06:41:52,2013-07-18 22:27:30
